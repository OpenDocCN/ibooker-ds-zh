    first edition of this book was published in 2012, during a time when open source
    data analysis libraries for Python, especially pandas, were very new and developing
    rapidly. When the time came to write the second edition in 2016 and 2017, I needed
    to update the book not only for Python 3.6 (the first edition used Python 2.7)
    but also for the many changes in pandas that had occurred over the previous five
    years. Now in 2022, there are fewer Python language changes (we are now at Python
    3.10, with 3.11 coming out at the end of 2022), but pandas has continued to evolve.

- en: In this third edition, my goal is to bring the content up to date with current
    versions of Python, NumPy, pandas, and other projects, while also remaining relatively
    conservative about discussing newer Python projects that have appeared in the
    last few years. Since this book has become an important resource for many university
    courses and working professionals, I will try to avoid topics that are at risk
    of falling out of date within a year or two. That way paper copies won't be too
    difficult to follow in 2023 or 2024 or beyond.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    on my website at [https://wesmckinney.com/book](https://wesmckinney.com/book),
    to serve as a resource and convenience for owners of the print and digital editions.
    I intend to keep the content reasonably up to date there, so if you own the paper
    book and run into something that doesn't work properly, you should check there
    for the latest content changes.

    be hard to overstate. In addition to developing matplotlib in the early 2000s
    (a time when Python was not nearly so popular), he helped shape the culture of
    a critical generation of open source developers who've become pillars of the Python
    ecosystem that we now often take for granted.
  prefs: []

- en: I was lucky enough to connect with John early in my open source career in January
    2010, just after releasing pandas 0.1\. His inspiration and mentorship helped
    me push forward, even in the darkest of times, with my vision for pandas and Python
    as a first-class data analysis language.

    Jupyter, and many other initiatives in the Python community. We had hoped to work
    on a book together, the four of us, but I ended up being the one with the most
    free time. I am sure he would be proud of what we've accomplished, as individuals
    and as a community, over the last nine years.

    book and more than 15 years since I originally started my journey as a Python
    programmer. A lot has changed since then! Python has evolved from a relatively
    niche language for data analysis to the most popular and most widely used language
    powering the plurality (if not the majority!) of data science, machine learning,
    and artificial intelligence work.

    2013, but its worldwide developer community has continued to thrive, serving as
    a model of community-centric open source software development. Many "next-generation"
    Python projects that deal with tabular data are modeling their user interfaces
    directly after pandas, so the project has proved to have an enduring influence
    on the future trajectory of the Python data science ecosystem.
