- en: The business model of automobile insurance (and therefore of most large insurance
    carriers) is changing drastically. Seemingly every month, an innovation is announced
    that at some point will have all of us chauffeured around in autonomous vehicles
    that never have an accident and are never exposed to the weather. But there are
    clouds forming. Extreme personalization of underwriting risk, and therefore the
    premium charged, may not be fair and ethical for everyone.

  zh: 汽车保险的商业模型（因此大多数大型保险公司的商业模式）正在发生 drastcally 的变化。看起来每个月都会有一项创新被宣布，最终会使我们所有人都在无人驾驶汽车中环游，永不发生事故，永不暴露于天气之中。但是，云正在聚集。承保风险的极端个性化及因此收取的保费可能对每个人来说都不公平和不道德。
- en: When an accident occurs, people and societies depend on the financial backing
    of insurance to defray the cost of damages and injuries (yes, accidents and weather-related
    damages will still happen). The way this works today (in a simplified view) is
    that insurance companies create policies with generic ratings for different types
    of drivers and vehicles. The underwriting and rating are designed to spread the
    risk. That means that lots of drivers will pay a little bit more to cover the
    few who have accidents. This seems appropriate when you never know which driver
    will get into an accident.

  zh: 当事故发生时，人们和社会依赖保险的财务支持来支付损害和伤害的费用（是的，事故和与天气有关的损害仍会发生）。今天的工作方式（以简化的方式来看）是保险公司为不同类型的驾驶员和车辆创建具有通用评级的政策。承保和评级旨在分散风险。这意味着很多驾驶员会支付更多的钱来覆盖那些发生事故的少数人。当你永远不知道哪个司机会发生事故时，这似乎是适当的。
- en: But the way the industry has been moving for the last 10 years or so, with AI,
    machine learning, and lots more data, is toward individual rates that predict
    the frequency and severity of accidents and the specific drivers who will have
    them, or at least smaller and smaller segments of like drivers. Things get more
    complicated when considering usage-based insurance, or “UBI,” powered by telematics.
    Again, this is now possible because of all kinds of technology and data that are
    the offspring of AI-related innovations.

  zh: 但是，过去大约10年来，行业发展的方向是朝着能够预测事故发生频率和严重程度以及哪些特定驾驶员可能会发生事故，或者至少是越来越小的类似驾驶员群体的个人费率，AI、机器学习和大量数据在推动这一变化。考虑到基于使用的保险或“UBI”，由远程技术支持。再次，这种情况是由AI相关创新的各种技术和数据所支持的。
- en: 'There are two major problems with the application of AI technology for personal
    auto insurance: (1) the data can simply be wrong (in fact, some of the data is
    very likely to be wrong some of the time); (2) analysts must make lots of choices
    when considering historic data for rating, and some of those choices lead to data
    being wrongly interpreted. Human biases are in the mix of rates that can affect
    whether people can afford auto insurance and can drive legally, given mandatory
    insurance laws.'

  zh: 个人汽车保险应用AI技术存在两个主要问题：（1）数据可能简单地错误（实际上，有些数据很可能在某些时候是错误的）；（2）分析师在考虑历史数据进行评估时必须做出很多选择，其中一些选择会导致数据被错误解释。人类偏见影响着可以影响人们是否负担得起汽车保险以及是否合法驾驶的费率混合。
- en: Driving is very often a necessity to make a living and take care of families.
    For some, auto insurance can cost more than rent, and the premium takes up a much
    larger share of the incomes of the lower economic classes who likely depend on
    their vehicles the most.

  zh: 驾驶往往是谋生和照顾家庭的必要条件。对于一些人来说，汽车保险费用可能比租金还要高，而保费占据了经济较低阶层收入的更大比例，他们很可能最依赖自己的车辆。
- en: While we want insurance that fairly reflects our individual risk, pure usage-based
    insurance applied very granularly is not a great idea socially. As such, while
    the AI wave enables the extreme personalization of auto insurance, companies and
    regulators will have to determine what level of “individual” risk and what level
    of “shared” risk makes sense for all of us.

  zh: 虽然我们希望保险能够公平地反映我们个人的风险，但纯粹基于使用的保险应用非常细致可能在社会上不是一个好主意。因此，尽管AI浪潮使得汽车保险极端个性化成为可能，但公司和监管机构必须确定“个人”风险水平和“共享”风险水平对我们所有人来说是有意义的水平。
- en: As for data curation and the fairness of noisy and interpreted data, someone
    must “wear the hat” of the data ethicists when this data is being curated. And
    this person must have the power to direct how the data should be interpreted or
    whether it should be used at all.

- en: While the AI-powered world of insurance is exciting and beneficial to society
    overall, it must be guided and tempered by wise analysts who are formally coached
    in the ethical use of data and by wise executives and regulators who can figure
    out what’s the fairest use of this amazing technology.
