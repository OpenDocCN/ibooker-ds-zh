    types, from the providers that administer care, to the insurance carriers (payers)
    who manage claims and process benefits, to pharmaceutical and medical equipment
    manufacturers. At the heart of the healthcare industry is the drive and necessity
    to improve health and health outcomes. The byproduct of this guiding light is

- en: With regards to patient care, analytics often takes the form of segmenting populations
    of care, by health markers such as chronic medical conditions, socioeconomic distinctions
    such as federal or state insurance coverage, or by stage of life. Here it is typical

  zh: 在患者护理方面，分析通常以健康标志物如慢性疾病、社会经济区分如联邦或州级保险覆盖，或生活阶段为基础进行分割。在这里，通常会发现不同类型的比率用于表达指标。
- en: One is a *per thousand patient* (*PP*) *ratio*. The PP ratio is a way to express
    frequency in layman’s terms, one of the most common being the existence of a disease
    among 1,000 people or the number of available hospital beds per 1,000 people.
    The uniqueness of this ratio is that by computing against 1,000, the number becomes
    analogous to the number of impacted individuals. It also serves to express smaller
    numbers with more prominence; for example a disease that affects 1% of a population
    becomes 10 patients per 1,000.

  zh: 其中一个是*每千患者*（PP）*比率*。PP比率是一种用通俗语言表达频率的方式，其中最常见的一种是在1,000人中存在某种疾病或每1,000人中可用的医院床位数。这种比率的独特之处在于，通过对1,000进行计算，该数字成为受影响个体的类比值。它还用于突出显示较小的数字；例如，影响1%人口的疾病变成了每1,000人中的10位患者。
- en: Often metrics of this nature are trended over time with goals or thresholds
    added to help gauge their performance. Take a concrete example of a PP ratio for
    hospital beds available. There can be both a goal to have 100 beds available at
    all times per 1,000 people, aimed at ensuring access to care, and simultaneously
    a tracking of current capacity with a threshold so that if the number goes below
    10 PP, additional measures are to be taken to ensure that the population can be
    served.
  id: totrans-15

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 这类指标通常随时间趋势变化，并添加目标或阈值以帮助衡量其表现。以医院床位的PP比例为例。目标可能是每千人保持100张床位的可用性，旨在确保医疗服务的可及性；同时追踪当前的容量，并设定阈值，以便当PP数低于10时，采取额外措施以确保能够为人群提供服务。
- en: The other type of metric you are bound to come across is a *performance measurement*.
    This measurement has a numerator, indicating those impacted by the performance
    measurement’s goal, and a denominator, indicating the population of patients applicable
    to the measurement. These are common measurements for assessing and ensuring that
    quality metrics are upheld.

  zh: 您可能会遇到的另一种类型的指标是*绩效测量*。该测量具有一个分子，表示受绩效测量目标影响的人群，以及一个分母，表示适用于该测量的患者总数。这些是用于评估和确保保持质量指标的常见测量标准。
- en: As an example, the Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS)
    is an extremely popular way to assess the performance of healthcare plans; it
    constructs ratios across domains of care and benchmarks of comparison. These measures
    are usually expressed on a numerical scale from 0 to 100, representing the compliance
    of a measure. One example is the [Adult BMI Assessment (ABA)](https://www.ncqa.org/hedis/measures/adult-bmi-assessment),
    which measures the percentage of members from 18 to 74 years of age who had an
    outpatient visit and whose body mass index (BMI) was measured. These measures
    are critically important because they are typically reported back to authorities
    on an annual basis and demonstrate the KPIs with which payers and providers operate
    against. When analyzing these, it is important to compare against available benchmarks,
    changes among different populations served, and to express them in clear “hit
    or miss” terms.
  id: totrans-17

  zh: 举例来说，医疗有效性数据和信息集（HEDIS）是评估医疗计划绩效的极为流行的方法；它在护理领域构建比率，并进行比较基准设置。这些指标通常以0到100的数字范围表示，代表措施的符合度。一个例子是[成年人BMI评估（ABA）](https://www.ncqa.org/hedis/measures/adult-bmi-assessment)，该评估衡量了18至74岁成员中在门诊就诊并测量体重指数（BMI）的比例。这些措施非常重要，因为它们通常每年向管理机构报告，并展示付款方和提供者的关键绩效指标。在分析这些指标时，比较可用基准、不同服务人群之间的变化以及用清晰的“命中或未中”的术语表达它们是很重要的。
- en: Since most of the metrics you are going to encounter are ratios or rates, they
    lend well to line charts for time-based comparisons. Often these time horizons
    are broader (monthly, quarterly, annually), to allow for enough data collection
    and occurrence. They also often lag because of the insurance industry and may
    not be finalized for three or more months while claims are finalized and payments
    are made. So, in this realm, it is important to display a long range of data,
    typically at least two years. It is also important to express percentage point
    difference and percentage differences (rate of change)—the first used to easily
    communicate the magnitude of the change, and the second to express the velocity
    of that change.
  id: totrans-18
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 由于您将遇到的大多数指标都是比率或率，它们非常适合用于基于时间的比较线图。通常，这些时间范围更广泛（每月、每季度、每年），以允许充分的数据收集和事件发生。由于保险行业的原因，它们通常会滞后，并且在三个或更多个月内可能尚未最终确定，因为索赔正在最终确定和付款。因此，在这个领域，显示长期的数据范围非常重要，通常至少两年。同样重要的是表达百分点差异和百分比差异（变化率）——前者用于轻松传达变化的幅度，后者用于表达该变化的速度。
- en: Lastly within the healthcare industry, it is important to master the concept
    of *protected health information* (*PHI*). PHI is anything that refers to individually
    identifiable health information and is often a major source of concern. It must
    be considered at all times to ensure that data isn’t disaggregated enough to identify
    an individual data point as a person and that a data breach could also not provide
    individual information about a person. To that end, data storage has extra precautions
    and security guidelines, and analyses are often expressed only in aggregates.
    When working with stakeholders, it is important to identify what is and isn’t
    PHI and to identify the necessary levels of aggregation to allow for insight and
    anonymity.

  zh: 最后，在医疗保健行业中，掌握*受保护健康信息*（*PHI*）的概念非常重要。PHI 指的是任何涉及个体可识别健康信息的内容，通常是一个主要的关注点。必须始终考虑到这一点，以确保数据没有分解到足以识别某个数据点代表一个人，并且数据泄露也不能提供有关个人的信息。因此，数据存储需要额外的预防措施和安全指南，分析通常只以聚合形式表达。与利益相关者合作时，识别什么是和什么不是
    PHI 以及确定必要的聚合水平以实现洞察和匿名性是非常重要的。

    related to *assessments* (or standardized tests). Assessments are done on a semiannual
    or annual scale and measure the knowledge of a student against state and/or national
    standards of mastery. These values are used to not only communicate the mastery
    level of individual students, but also, aggregated together, to show effectiveness
    of curriculum, faculty, and school district. They also often become a critical
    KPI for the amount of funding a public school may receive.

  zh: 对于从幼儿园到高中阶段的所有内容，最重要的分析通常与*评估*（或标准化测试）有关。评估通常是半年或一年一度进行的，衡量学生的知识掌握程度是否达到国家或州的标准。这些值不仅用于传达单个学生的掌握水平，而且聚合在一起，显示课程、教职员工和学区的有效性。它们也经常成为公立学校可能获得资金量的关键绩效指标。
- en: Assessment data presents its own set of challenges. First, because it is typically
    administered by a body other than a school district, it is not integrated with
    other key applications (like a student information system) within a district.
    Therefore, demographic elements, attendance, and grade history are not easily
    and readily tied to the final score. Second, the data is often available as overly
    aggregated exports with poor structure. The poor data structure means that data
    must be preprocessed and typically pivoted (columns turned into rows) before thorough
    analysis can be done. Additionally, overaggregation takes place in the form of
    providing outcomes only at a grade level (versus individual student) or an individual
    school. This overaggregation makes it difficult for faculty and administration
    to compile a holistic view for their district while simultaneously identifying
    areas of true improvement.

  zh: 评估数据呈现了自己的一系列挑战。首先，因为它通常由学区之外的机构管理，所以不容易与学区内的其他关键应用程序（如学生信息系统）集成。因此，人口统计元素、出勤率和成绩历史不容易直接与最终分数联系起来。其次，数据通常以过于聚合的导出形式存在，结构不佳。不良的数据结构意味着在进行彻底分析之前，数据必须经过预处理，通常是将数据透视（将列转换为行）。此外，过度聚合表现为仅在年级水平（而不是个别学生）或单个学校提供结果。这种过度聚合使得教职员工和管理层难以编制出一个全面的学区视图，同时识别真正改进的领域。
- en: To unlock the power of assessment data, we recommend obtaining results at an
    individual student level, per assessment. Then pivot the data so that metrics
    that were previously columns present as dimensions (a good example is assessment
    subject). And finally, use the one key piece of information known to be available,
    a student ID, to marry up information from other systems of record. District administrators
    will want to be able to see results at a district, school, grade, and teacher
    level—and want the ability to compare peers among the lower levels of aggregation
    to pinpoint improvement opportunities. Pivoting the data also allows demographic
    student information to be married up with assessments more easily.

  zh: 要释放评估数据的力量，我们建议按照每位学生的个人水平获取评估结果。然后旋转数据，以便以前是列的指标现在作为维度出现（一个很好的例子是评估科目）。最后，使用已知的一项关键信息，即学生ID，将来自其他记录系统的信息进行匹配。区域管理员希望能够看到区域、学校、年级和教师层面的结果，并希望能够比较低层次聚合中的同行，以准确定位改进机会。旋转数据还允许更轻松地将学生人口统计信息与评估数据匹配起来。
- en: The last step in unlocking the value of assessment data is to form cohorts of
    students (often based on graduation years), allowing the entire course of a student
    population’s educational career to be seen and analyzed. This form of insight
    is powerful in identifying any gaps in curriculum and to track the long-term impacts
    and variation of socio-economic factors (for example, students on free or reduced
    lunch as compared to those who are not).
