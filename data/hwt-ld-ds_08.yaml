- en: With your superior integrity in managing projects and nuanced approaches in
    leading a productive team of data scientists, you are ready to take on greater
    responsibilities. You can lead a DS function with a team of teams, manage managers,
    and solve challenges you are not there to witness directly. You can also be on
    the individual contributor track as a principal data scientist, influencing partners
    of broader scopes and leading efforts of greater complexity.

  zh: 通过你在项目管理中的卓越诚信和在领导一支高效的数据科学家团队中的细微方法，你已准备好承担更大的责任。你可以领导一个由多个团队组成的DS职能，管理经理，并解决你直接见证不到的挑战。你也可以作为主要数据科学家在个人贡献者轨道上，影响更广泛的合作伙伴，并领导更复杂的努力。
- en: Leading at the DS function level requires a different set of skills than leading
    projects or teams of individuals. You are responsible for producing more significant
    impact over a longer horizon of time, often across multiple quarters. What differentiates
    this role is the clarity in focus and prioritization required for projects with
    longer time horizons.

  zh: 在DS职能层面进行领导需要与领导项目或个人团队所需的技能不同。你负责在更长的时间范围内产生更显著的影响，通常跨越多个季度。这一角色的区别在于对具有更长时间跨度的项目所需的专注度和优先级排序的清晰度。
- en: The clarity in focus and prioritization comes from a deep understanding of your
    company’s business model. You can leverage this understanding to craft roadmaps
    to accomplish strategic business objectives, while avoiding management and technology
    pitfalls.

  zh: 专注度和优先级排序的清晰度来自于对你公司商业模式的深刻理解。你可以利用这种理解来制定路线图以实现战略商业目标，同时避免管理和技术陷阱。
- en: An effective roadmap deconstructs an ultimate goal into a step-by-step strategy
    for your team leaders to execute. The execution of these roadmaps requires an
    acute sense of emerging issues in the organization, both technical and people
    related. Only when the milestones are completed successfully can the ultimate
    business objectives be accomplished.

  zh: 一个有效的路线图将最终目标分解为团队领导者可以执行的逐步策略。执行这些路线图需要敏锐地感知组织中的新兴问题，包括技术和与人员相关的问题。只有当里程碑成功完成，才能实现最终的商业目标。
- en: Efficient execution often requires a specific organization of teams for particular
    company initiatives at hand. Teams can be built and iteratively reorganized over
    time as you craft the function by managing its people, process, and platforms.
    To develop a resilient foundation for execution for the long term, you are also
    responsible for creating a robust hiring process for your talent pipelines and
    clear career paths for team members.

  zh: 高效执行通常需要针对特定公司倡议的特定团队组织。随着时间的推移，你可以通过管理其人员、流程和平台来构建和迭代重组团队，以构建职能。为了长期执行奠定坚实的基础，你还需要负责为你的人才管道创建稳健的招聘流程和为团队成员提供清晰的职业道路。
- en: These strategies’ success requires you to lead your DS teams at the function
    level for your company. In chapters 6 and 7, we dive into the capabilities and
    virtues you can demonstrate through discussions in technology, execution, expert
    domain knowledge, ethics, rigor, and attitude.
