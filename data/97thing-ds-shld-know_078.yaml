- en: The topics of data privacy and data ethics have grown significantly in importance
    over the past few years. This development has been driven in part by new legislation
    such as the EU’s GDPR and the CCPA, laws that are intended to provide more control,
    transparency, and ownership of data to individuals. These new laws, in addition
    to more new legislation on the horizon, could significantly limit the use of data,
    which could thwart innovation and impact our ability to provide valuable data-driven
    services to customers such as preventing fraud, providing relevant personalized
    products, and improving customer service. We should be very worried about these
    trends, especially as we are now seeing how massive amounts of unstructured data
    combined with artificial intelligence can provide tremendous improvements in client
    experiences as well as create new business opportunities.

  zh: 数据隐私和数据伦理问题的话题在过去几年中显著增长。这种发展部分是由于诸如欧盟的GDPR和加州隐私权法案（CCPA）等新立法的推动，这些法律旨在为个人提供更多的数据控制、透明度和所有权。除了眼下的这些新法律，未来还可能会出现更多新的立法，这些法律可能会显著限制数据的使用，这可能会阻碍创新并影响我们提供有价值的数据驱动服务的能力，如防止欺诈、提供相关个性化产品以及改善客户服务。我们应该非常担心这些趋势，特别是现在我们正在看到大量非结构化数据与人工智能相结合如何在客户体验方面带来巨大改进，以及如何创造新的业务机会。
- en: It is critically important that companies get ahead of the curve and take proactive
    steps to drive data ethics guidelines and best practices into their businesses.
    Many companies have appointed an individual to oversee the use of corporate data,
    giving them a title such as chief privacy officer, chief data officer, or chief
    compliance officer. These individuals have focused mostly on the legal aspects
    of data and on ensuring their company stays in compliance with the laws. That
    is understandable, as a violation of the law will result in severe consequences.
    We must, however, take data legality and privacy to the next level, and that is
    where data ethics comes in.

  zh: 公司必须抢先行动，采取积极步骤将数据伦理指南和最佳实践融入业务中至关重要。许多公司已经任命了一名负责监督企业数据使用的个人，赋予他们诸如首席隐私官、首席数据官或首席合规官等头衔。这些人主要关注数据的法律方面，确保公司遵守法律规定，这是可以理解的，因为违法行为将会导致严重后果。然而，我们必须把数据的合法性和隐私保护提升到一个新水平，这就是数据伦理的作用所在。
- en: Customers trust us to respect their privacy and use their data securely and
    ethically. We have seen many instances in which poor data ethics has resulted
    in a tarnished brand, loss of customers, and a drop in company profits. Data ethics
    goes beyond what is required by law and is about the proper collection, management,
    and use of data within an organization. A company may, for example, leverage a
    wide set of data for highly targeted marketing offers through programmatic ad
    buying, but if the offer is intrusive and out of context and leverages sensitive
    confidential information, then the “creepy factor” may set in and create concerns
    for the consumer. The short-term impact of increased sales could be miniscule
    compared to the long-term loss of trust and brand consideration. Smart organizations
    recognize the importance of building trust with their customers and prospects
    and are incorporating data ethics guidelines and practices into their operations.

  zh: 客户信任我们尊重其隐私并安全、合乎伦理地使用他们的数据。我们已经看到许多情况下，不良的数据伦理导致品牌受损、客户流失和公司利润下降。数据伦理不仅仅是法律要求，还涉及组织内部数据的正确收集、管理和使用。例如，一家公司可能会通过程序化广告购买利用广泛的数据集进行高度针对性的营销活动，但如果这种提供是具有侵入性且不合时宜，并且利用了敏感的机密信息，那么可能会引发消费者的“怪异感”，并引起其担忧。增加销售的短期影响可能微不足道，而长期失去信任和品牌考虑则可能会带来更大的损失。聪明的组织意识到与客户和潜在客户建立信任的重要性，并将数据伦理指南和实践纳入其运营中。
- en: 'Analytics leaders are in a unique position to contribute to this effort, as
    they and their teams generally have the deepest knowledge of how data is collected,
    organized, and used in their firms. It is time for analytics leaders to step up
    and play a key leadership role in advancing the data privacy and ethics practices
    within their organizations. Here are some immediate suggestions on how to play
    that leadership role:'

  zh: 分析领导者在这方面具有独特的贡献机会，因为他们及其团队通常对数据如何在公司中收集、组织和使用有最深入的了解。现在是分析领导者挺身而出，在其组织内推动数据隐私和伦理实践的关键领导角色的时候了。以下是如何发挥这一领导角色的一些即时建议：
- en: Join the company’s enterprise data council.

  zh: 加入公司的企业数据委员会。
- en: If such an entity doesn’t exist, then influence the company to start one. This
    council should be cross-functional and should perform a number of functions, including
    establishing data ethics guidelines, ensuring those guidelines are well understood
    across the company, and reviewing and approving new uses of data. The approval
    for a new data use should consider the business value, consumer privacy, and the
    value the application brings to the consumer, as well as brand and operational
    risk. Different people will no doubt have different opinions, but through the
    cross-functional discussion a consensus decision can usually be reached or the
    data use appropriately modified. As the analytics leader on the council, you will
    be able to explain how data is used to support different use cases; this will
    be valuable in educating the council and providing important new areas to discuss
    and resolve.

  zh: 如果公司还没有这样的机构，则影响公司成立一个。这个委员会应该是跨职能的，应执行多项职能，包括制定数据伦理指南、确保全公司对这些指南有充分的理解，并审查和批准数据的新用途。对新数据使用的批准应考虑业务价值、消费者隐私以及应用为消费者带来的价值，以及品牌和运营风险。毫无疑问，不同的人可能会有不同的意见，但通过跨职能讨论，通常可以达成共识决策或适当修改数据使用。作为委员会上的分析领导者，您将能够解释数据如何支持不同的用例；这将有助于教育委员会并提供重要的新领域来讨论和解决问题。

  zh: 制定衡量数据伦理的策略。
- en: Metrics can be created to measure internal processes, but more importantly,
    the strategy should include metrics to understand how you are perceived by customers.
    Many companies have ongoing surveys to measure brand health, customer sentiment,
    trust, and so on. By adding a few questions about data ethics and privacy, you
    will establish a benchmark that can be tracked and measured over time. Another
    source of insight will be found by mining unstructured data using AI/machine learning
    algorithms. Voice/text data from call centers and emails, social posts and blogs
    (Twitter, Reddit, etc.), and internal customer complaint databases are important
    sources to analyze daily for trends and for providing immediate indicators of
    any data ethics issues. Opt-out rates can also be tracked for trending purposes,
    as well as for identifying the reason behind the opt-outs so that adjustments
    in marketing content and frequency can be made when necessary.

  zh: 可以创建指标来衡量内部流程，但更重要的是，战略应包括用于了解客户感知的指标。许多公司进行持续调查以衡量品牌健康状况、客户情绪、信任等。通过增加几个关于数据伦理和隐私的问题，您将建立一个可以随时间追踪和衡量的基准。通过使用AI/机器学习算法挖掘非结构化数据，还可以找到另一个洞察的来源。来自呼叫中心和电子邮件、社交帖子和博客（Twitter、Reddit等）以及内部客户投诉数据库的语音/文本数据是分析每日趋势和提供任何数据伦理问题的即时指示的重要来源。还可以跟踪退出率以用于趋势分析，并确定退出背后的原因，从而在必要时调整营销内容和频率。

- en: Data scientists are great at finding and integrating data for the models, but
    just because the data exists in your enterprise data warehouse or can be scraped
    from an external website doesn’t mean that data can be used ethically. Strong
    analytical teams have up-front planning processes in place before algorithms are
    created, and each use case should also be reviewed from a data ethics perspective.
    Does your company have authority to use the proposed data? Does the application
    violate any laws or privacy policies? Does the use case provide value to the customer
    as well as the company? Will there be a “creepy factor” that could tarnish the
    company’s brand? These questions are all areas that data scientists need to review
    and escalate to the enterprise data council when in doubt.

  zh: 数据科学家擅长发现和整合模型所需的数据，但仅仅因为数据存在于您的企业数据仓库中或可以从外部网站抓取，并不意味着可以在道德上使用这些数据。在算法创建之前，强大的分析团队需要进行前期规划，并且每个使用案例也应从数据伦理的角度进行审查。你的公司是否有权使用所提议的数据？该应用是否违反任何法律或隐私政策？使用案例是否为客户和公司提供价值？是否会出现可能影响公司品牌的“怪异因素”？这些问题都是数据科学家在怀疑时需要审查并升级到企业数据委员会的领域。
- en: In summary, analytics leaders can play a big leadership role in establishing
    and implementing robust data ethics practices for their company. This will lead
    to better management and use of data, greater data protection for customers, and
    lower risk to a company’s brand equity.
