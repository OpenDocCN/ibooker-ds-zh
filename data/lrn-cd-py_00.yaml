- en: This unit begins with a bit of motivation on why learning to program is beneficial
    no matter who you are; you can even use programming in your daily life to make
    certain tasks easier. You’ll briefly be introduced to ideas you should be familiar
    with before starting to program, and you’ll get an idea of the kinds of things
    you’ll be able to do by the end of this book.

  zh: 本单元从一点动机开始，说明无论你是谁，学习编程都是有益的；你甚至可以在日常生活中使用编程来简化某些任务。你将简要介绍在开始编程之前你应该熟悉的一些概念，并且你将了解在本书结束时你将能够完成的一些事情。
- en: 'The unit ends by drawing a parallel with baking so that you can see programming
    as a skill requiring practice and creativity. This unit also serves as an overview
    of what you should expect as you go through this journey: lots and lots of practice!
    Learning to program seems like a big undertaking, but it’s best to take small
    steps every day rather than giant occasional leaps. It’s a challenging but rewarding
    path.'
