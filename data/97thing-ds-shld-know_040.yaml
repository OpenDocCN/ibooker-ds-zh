    career success, my coauthor, Dave Mathias, and I have interviewed chief data officers
    and chief analytics officers from Fortune 500 companies, and one theme has resounded
    throughout all of our discussions: silos (data silos and perspective silos) create
    problems. The ethical risk here is that in ignoring best practices and maintaining
    obsolete data silos, CDOs put their organizations at risk for unethical, and possibly
    illegal, behaviors.'

  zh: 在我们准备撰写一本关注首席数据官（CDO）职业成功的书籍时，我的合著者戴夫·马西亚斯和我采访了来自财富500强公司的首席数据官和首席分析官，一个主题贯穿了我们所有的讨论：信息孤岛（数据孤岛和视角孤岛）带来了问题。这里的伦理风险在于，如果忽视最佳实践并保持过时的数据孤岛，CDO们会使他们的组织面临不道德甚至可能非法的行为风险。
- en: 'From a management perspective, data silos are databases, data warehouses, data
    lakes, and so forth in which data is stored for one purpose and is not integrated
    with the rest of the data that an organization owns. As consumers, we run into
    this all the time. Think about the last time you called a customer service phone
    number. They may have recognized your phone number, and you may have entered your
    sixteen-digit account number and made five or six selections in the automated
    menu, but when you finally get to speak to a human being, they still don’t know
    who you are or what you are calling about. That kind of problem happens when the
    incoming call system is not well integrated with the customer account records.
    Managers bemoan this situation, because from their perspective, if they are running
    a report on sales but don’t have it correlated to their accounts receivable system,
    then they may be getting bad data: yes, sales are very high at customer X, but
    if they are not paying their bills, is it really good business?'

  zh: 从管理的角度来看，数据孤岛是数据库、数据仓库、数据湖等，其中数据被存储用于特定目的，但未与组织拥有的其他数据集成。作为消费者，我们经常遇到这种情况。想想你上次打客服电话的情况。他们可能识别了你的电话号码，你可能输入了你的16位账号，然后在自动菜单中做了五六个选择，但当你最终与人类交谈时，他们仍然不知道你是谁或你打电话的目的。这种问题发生在呼入系统与客户账户记录未良好集成的情况下。管理者对此深感痛心，因为从他们的角度来看，如果他们正在对销售进行报告，但又没有与应收账款系统相关联，那么他们可能得到的是错误的数据：是的，在X客户那里销售额非常高，但如果他们不支付账单，这真的是好的商业吗？
- en: Often, isolated silos of data arise in companies as legacy artifacts of mergers
    and acquisitions that were never fully integrated into the acquiring companies’
    processes and systems. Sometimes silos exist because specialty software exists
    to serve one part of the business, but regardless of how they arise, they are
    the bane of upper management for several reasons. First and foremost, unintegrated
    data is simply less valuable than integrated, unified, holistically accessible
    data. Companies have realized that the data they have on clients, products, production
    runs, logistics, and so on gives them valuable insight into operations, customers,
    leading economic indicators for their particular industries, demand, and usage
    patterns, just to name a few things. If a company’s data is isolated into data
    silos, then managers have just a small sliver of a view of the data and can harvest
    only some of the value that a unified, overall picture can provide. This is a
    risk to the business because leaders don’t have a big-picture view of what is
    really happening. In effect, executives have a blinkered view of the state of
    the business and the key interconnections across it. By consciously maintaining
    this blinkered view, executives are willfully ignoring key data, a dereliction
    of their duty to serve the business to the best of their ability. This is often
    described as the “1 + 1 = 3” phenomenon. One set of data gives you certain valuable
    insights, another gives you other insights, but combined and properly integrated,
    the two datasets provide more value than the sum of their parts. Now extrapolate
    that for three, four, or more datasets, and you start to gain perspective on the
    scale of the problem. Next, silos are bad from an operations perspective—a wider,
    more specialized workforce is required to support the diverse silos. Silos also
    create endless headaches for IT leadership, which needs to support couture systems
    on arcane infrastructures. But I digress.

  zh: 通常，公司中会出现数据孤岛，这些数据孤岛是并购的遗留物，从未完全整合到收购公司的流程和系统中。有时候，数据孤岛之所以存在，是因为专业软件只服务于业务的某一部分，但不管它们是如何产生的，它们都成为高级管理人员的噩梦，原因有几个。首先且最重要的是，未经整合的数据比整合、统一且全面可访问的数据简直不值钱。公司已经意识到，他们拥有的客户数据、产品数据、生产数据、物流数据等等为他们的运营、客户、特定行业的主导经济指标、需求和使用模式等提供了宝贵的洞察。如果公司的数据被孤立成数据孤岛，那么管理人员只能看到数据的一小部分，并且只能收获整体图片可以提供的部分价值。这对业务是一种风险，因为领导者没有对实际情况有全局性的视角。实际上，高管对业务状况和其关键交互联系的全面视角存在视觉狭隘的情况。通过有意识地保持这种视觉狭隘，高管们故意忽视了关键数据，这是对他们尽职尽责的一种玩忽职守。这通常被描述为“1
    + 1 = 3”的现象。一组数据给你一些宝贵的洞察，另一组给你其他洞察，但是结合并正确整合这两个数据集，它们提供的价值超过各自部分的总和。现在将这种情况推广到三个、四个或更多的数据集，你就开始了解到问题的规模。接下来，数据孤岛从运营的角度来看也是不利的——需要更广泛、更专业的员工队伍来支持多样化的数据孤岛。数据孤岛还给IT领导层带来了无尽的头疼，他们需要支持复杂的系统和古老的基础设施。但我岂止一句。
- en: 'It is not just silos of data that create problems; perspective silos are another
    problem. What the CDOs have told us time and again is this: spending time in different
    job roles, different industries, and different perspectives was essential to each
    individual’s journey to senior leadership. Every senior leader we spoke with credited
    diversity of education and work experiences in their career as a key characteristic
    that led to their ultimate success. They see challenges from a variety of stakeholders’
    perspectives because they have sat in different roles across the organization.'

  zh: 创造问题的不仅仅是数据孤岛；视角孤岛也是另一个问题。首席数据官们一再告诉我们的是：在不同的职位、不同的行业和不同的视角中花费时间对每个人的晋升到高级领导地位的旅程至关重要。我们与每位高级领导人交谈时，都认为教育和工作经验的多样性是导致他们最终成功的关键特征。他们因为曾在组织的不同角色中工作过，所以能从各种利益相关者的视角看待挑战。

- en: 'More and more, I worried about the separation between technical models and
    real people, and about the moral repercussions of that separation. In fact, I
    saw the same pattern emerging that I’d witnessed in finance: a false sense of
    security was leading to widespread use of imperfect models, self-serving definitions
    of success, and growing feedback loops.'

  zh: 越来越多地，我担心技术模型与真实人群之间的隔离，以及这种隔离带来的道德后果。事实上，我看到了与金融领域相似的模式出现：一种错误的安全感导致了不完美模型的广泛使用，以及自私的成功定义和日益增长的反馈循环。
- en: This is another way to say that siloed views, lack of perspective, and lack
    of diverse viewpoints create pernicious outcomes. In some circumstances, these
    pernicious outcomes cross legal boundaries, putting a CDO’s company at risk. In
    addition, these outcomes may be unethical as well—a further risk in an economy
    where stakeholders are seeking to align their investment goals with their ethical
    principles.

  zh: 这句话的另一种表达方式是，分立的视角、缺乏透视力和缺乏多元化观点会导致有害结果。在某些情况下，这些有害结果会越过法律界限，使CDO的公司面临风险。此外，这些结果可能也是不道德的——在经济体系中，利益相关者正试图将其投资目标与其道德原则对齐，这是进一步的风险。
- en: In conclusion, silos create problems. Silos can be data silos, where the complete
    value of the constituent data components is not harvested due to parochial views,
    or they can be perspective silos, where organizations lack perspective to view
    opportunities and challenges from diverse enough directions and thus set themselves
    up for failure.

  zh: 总之，分立视角造成了问题。分立可以是数据分立，即由于狭隘视角而无法完全利用构成数据组成部分的价值，或者是透视分立，即组织缺乏足够的透视力从多元化的角度看待机会和挑战，从而使自己陷入失败境地。
