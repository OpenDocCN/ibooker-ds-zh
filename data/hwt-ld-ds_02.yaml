- en: 'In your journey toward producing a greater impact in the world with DS, becoming
    a tech lead and driving project integrity is often the first step. You are discovering
    your personal limitations as an individual contributor: you can only write so
    many lines of code and analyze so much data in a day. For some, it can be hard
    to acknowledge our own finiteness as individual humans. The sooner we realize
    our own limitations, the more time we have to start practicing what has made human
    civilizations so powerful, which is our capability to organize and lead.'

  zh: 在您使用DS在世界上产生更大影响的过程中，成为技术领导者和推动项目完整性通常是第一步。您正在发现作为个人贡献者的个人局限性：您每天只能编写这么多行代码和分析这么多数据。对一些人来说，承认我们作为个体的有限性可能很困难。我们越早意识到自己的局限性，就有更多时间开始实践使人类文明如此强大的能力，那就是我们的组织和领导能力。
- en: So what is the *tech lead* role? The tech lead role focuses on leadership and
    management in technology and projects. This is in contrast to the manager role,
    which focuses on people and team management.

  zh: 那么，*技术领导者*的角色是什么？技术领导者角色专注于技术和项目中的领导和管理工作。这与专注于人员和团队管理的经理角色形成对比。
- en: To enter a tech lead role, the biggest challenge for an individual contributor
    is the practice of influence. You are expected to lead and mentor a team of data
    scientists, and work with business and engineering partners, often without any
    of them reporting to you.

  zh: 要进入技术领导者的角色，对个人贡献者来说最大的挑战是影响力的实践。您被期望领导并指导一组数据科学家，并与业务和工程合作伙伴合作，通常他们中没有人向您汇报。
- en: At the same time, a tech lead is at the front line of where all the DS gets
    done. An organization depends on strong DS tech leads to conduct data-driven projects
    with a detailed understanding of business needs, data properties, and data nuances.
    From this position, you can provide detailed feedback to junior data scientists
    to nurture them technically, and you can provide the earliest feedback and escalation
    to management when something is going wrong.

  zh: 同时，技术领导者是所有DS工作的前沿。一个组织依赖于强大的DS技术领导者来执行数据驱动型项目，这些项目对业务需求、数据属性和数据细微差别有详细的了解。从这个位置，您可以向初级数据科学家提供详细的反馈，以技术方面培养他们，并且当出现问题的时候，您可以向管理层提供最早的反馈和升级。
- en: Chapters 2 and 3 focus on the capabilities and virtues of a DS tech lead. You
    will be introduced to the pieces of the TEE-ERA Fan, covering the six dimensions
    of technology, execution, expert knowledge, ethics, rigor, and attitude.

  zh: 第二章和第三章专注于DS技术领导者的能力和美德。您将了解到TEE-ERA Fan的各个部分，涵盖技术、执行、专业知识、伦理、严谨和态度六个维度。
- en: The chapters illustrate the aspirational goals in each dimension and aim to
    lay out career paths for DS tech leads. Managers can reference these topics to
    guide their team members’ professional development, but should not use them as
    reasons to hold back promotions. If a tech lead has demonstrated capabilities
    and virtues in some topics and potential in others, they could be ready for more
    responsibilities.

  zh: 这些章节展示了每个维度的期望目标，旨在为DS技术领导者规划职业道路。管理者可以参考这些主题来指导团队成员的职业发展，但不应该将它们作为阻止晋升的理由。如果一个技术领导者在某些主题上展示了能力和美德，在其他主题上具有潜力，他们可能已经准备好承担更多责任。
- en: Tech lead is the entry-level individual contributor leadership role. Companies
    that have established a technical track in DS can have staff, principal, and distinguished
    data scientist positions with a similar scope of technical influence as managers,
    directors, and executives—mostly without the people management responsibilities.
    All right, let’s get into the capabilities and virtues of leading projects.

  zh: 技术领导者是入门级个人贡献者领导角色。在DS中建立了技术路径的公司可以拥有员工、主管和杰出数据科学家职位，这些职位的范围与经理、总监和执行人员相似，主要是没有人员管理责任。好吧，让我们深入了解领导项目的能力和美德。
