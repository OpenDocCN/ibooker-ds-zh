    (ML) project to solve a business problem that’s big enough and difficult enough
    to need a team. The rapid surge of interest in ML and the sudden change in ML’s
    capability with the development of practical deep neural networks documented by
    LeCun et al. [1] and other advanced methods such as MCMC algorithms discussed
    by Carpenter et al. [2] means that there are a lot of new opportunities for ML
    projects. So, a lot of people are going to be managing these projects, and this
    is a guidebook for them.

- en: Why is a guidebook needed specifically for ML projects? It’s claimed by Gartner
    that 85% of ML projects fail [3], although tracking down the precise origin and
    evidence for this claim is more work than this author is willing to put in! Even
    so, it’s clear from scholarly studies that there are “challenges to these steps
    of the machine-learning development workflow” and “practitioners face issues at
    each stage of the development process”. For example, see the work by Paleyes and
    co-authors [4]. As the difficulties of developing and deploying ML systems are
    becoming clearer, there are increasing concerns that ML is being applied unethically
    and harmfully [5]. Fundamentally, ML projects have a different development process
    (model building from data) from normal software projects, have different needs
    in terms of organization and infrastructure, and deliver outputs (ML models) that
    have to be handled differently from normal programs.

  zh: 为什么需要专门为机器学习项目编写指南？据Gartner称，85%的机器学习项目失败[3]，尽管追踪这一说法的确切起源和证据比作者愿意投入的工作要多！即便如此，从学术研究中可以看出，在机器学习开发工作流程的这些步骤中存在“挑战”，并且在开发过程的每个阶段，实践者都会面临问题。例如，参见Paleyes及其合作者的工作[4]。随着开发和部署ML系统困难性的日益明显，越来越多的人担心ML正在被不道德和有害地应用[5]。从根本上讲，ML项目与普通软件项目相比，具有不同的开发过程（从数据构建模型），在组织和基础设施方面有不同的需求，并且提供的结果（ML模型）需要以与普通程序不同的方式处理。
- en: One driving idea behind the book is that doing ML projects is a bit like going
    on a roller coaster ride. The brightly painted roller coaster is what everyone
    focuses on, but riding it only takes three minutes. To ride it, you have to get
    everyone in the car, drive for an hour, park, walk to the ticket office, get tickets,
    and queue for the ride. The point is that to have fun, you have to prepare. After
    the ride, what then? Well, then you get to the real point of the ride. You get
    to sit with your kids and eat ice cream and talk about how good it was and what
    you are going to do next and why. If the before and after parts of the process
    aren’t good, then the fun part (the ML in the ML project) doesn’t happen.

  zh: 本书背后的一个主要思想是，进行ML项目有点像乘坐过山车。明亮的过山车是每个人关注的焦点，但乘坐它只需要三分钟。要乘坐它，你必须让所有人上车，开车一个小时，停车，走到售票处，购票，然后排队等候。重点是，为了好玩，你必须做好准备。过山车之后呢？好吧，然后你到达过山车的真正目的。你可以和你的孩子坐在一起吃冰淇淋，谈论它有多好，你接下来要做什么，以及为什么。如果这个过程的前后部分不好，那么有趣的部分（ML项目中的ML）就不会发生。

    to use the results, and the safeguards to prevent ML from going astray. After

    models from data. The model can be expressed in lots of ways, e.g., a set of if/then/else
    statements, a decision tree, or a set of parameters or weights for a neural network.

    the difference between dogs and cats or the commonalities between Great Danes
    and Chihuahuas. In this case, the model is combined with partial data about the

- en: When humans build models manually, they choose the association rules or the
    network parameters, so the amount of experimentation that they can do is limited.
    The advantage of an ML approach is that the machine can check a large number of
    parameters or associations. Machines can search over millions or billions of different
    settings and links quickly and cheaply. The human’s advantage (for instance, a
    statistician or an epidemiologist) is that they know what they are doing. Often,
    this ability to apply common sense and a wider knowledge of the world means the
    models chosen and created by humans are superior to the models learned by machines.
    It also means that humans can build models without needing to access large amounts
    of data. Recently, though, ML has gained importance because using the huge computing
    power that’s now available to process abundant supplies of data is much, much
    cheaper and easier than devising the models by hand.

    means that it must be cleaned and assembled into examples that can be passed into
    the models. Once that’s done, the models can consume it. Sometimes we can use
    a single model, but as figure 1.1 illustrates, it’s also common for a set of models
    to be produced and chained together to create the inferences that we require,
    and these models need to be managed and governed by a support team of operators.
    Occasionally, the models’ output is reviewed by a supervising human who makes
    decisions about how they will affect their ultimate consumers. In other scenarios,
    the model results are mediated by another system and then consumed by users more

    are approximate, hard to interpret, and hard to develop. They don’t give the right
    answers most of the time, and they are robust and appropriate for some applications
    but not others. There is more uncertainty and risk in an ML project than in normal
    software development. Also, ML systems are heavily dependent on large-scale data
    resources. Data is collected by people with agendas, whether they know that or
    not, and so it’s riddled with bias. The way that humans interact with ML systems
    can create loops and spirals of behavior that the original designers find surprising.
    Handling large data resources reliably and efficiently is problematic and can
    be challenging for teams used to running software projects.

- en: People have created software systems for more than 50 years, and for a great
    chunk of that time, they’ve built ML systems as well. It’s therefore worth checking
    what other people have done. For many years, software development was planned
    and organized around predictions of the complexity and work required to deliver
    a project. We call this approach *waterfall*. Essentially the idea is that the
    required information was gathered, and this was transformed into a design. The
    design was then changed into a work program for the programmers, and next, the
    programmers wrote the code and submitted it to testing. Finally, the system was
    accepted by the users—the waterfall.

    of the hardware that it ran on (because that hardware got a lot faster), the value

    were disconnected from the process that produced it. There were other problems

    methodologies, coupled with a lack of evidence that these practices delivered

    more iterative methodology with “uphill feedback” at each stage (Royce 1970) and
    the development of and exploration of new approaches: Spiral (Boehm 1986), based
    on plan-do-study-act cycles developed to support decision making under pressure,

    is an attempt to build a bridge between developers (dev) and the support teams
    that operate the software (ops). The insight driving DevOps is that the operations
    team is a group of experts, more in touch with software than any other part of
    an organization. A major barrier to using this software is the cost of the mismatch
    between the dev teams’ understanding of the production environment and reality.
    This cost is borne by both the dev team (trying to achieve its goal of delivering
    software) and the ops team (trying to achieve its aim of faultless business continuity).

    rapid and adaptive software development. A DevOps team develops automation around
    the processes of developing and delivering software. This allows them to focus
    on the development itself as the project matures. Information flow into the project
    activities is promoted by reducing the cost and risk of changing the software
    later in its development cycle. Typically, this is when (late in the project)
    users and stakeholders realize what it’s actually going to do and how it’s going
