  zh: 预测作为服务
- en: Because time series forecasting has fewer expert practitioners than other areas
    of data science, there has been a drive to develop time series analysis and forecasting
    as a service that can be easily packaged and rolled out in an efficient way. For
    example, and as noted in [Chapter 16](ch16.html#time_series_packages_chapter),
    Amazon recently rolled out a time series prediction service, and it’s not the
    only company to do so. The company’s model seems deliberately general, and it
    frames forecasting as just one step in a data pipeline (see [Figure 17-1](#fig-1701)).

  zh: 由于时间序列预测的专业从业者比数据科学的其他领域少，因此有一种驱动力去开发时间序列分析和预测作为服务，可以轻松打包并以高效的方式推广。例如，正如在[第16章](ch16.html#time_series_packages_chapter)中所述，亚马逊最近推出了一个时间序列预测服务，并且不止这一家公司这么做。该公司的模型似乎有意地设计得很通用，并将预测框架化为数据管道中的一个步骤（见[图17-1](#fig-1701)）。
- en: These forecasting-as-a-service modeling endeavors aim for a good enough general
    model that can accommodate a variety of fields without making terribly inaccurate
    forecasts. Most of them describe their models as using a mix of deep learning
    and traditional statistical models. However, because the service is ultimately
    a black box, it will be difficult to understand what could make forecasts go wrong
    or even to retrospectively investigate how they can be improved. This means there
    is a reasonably high quality level for the forecasts but probably a performance
    ceiling as well.

  zh: 这些作为服务的预测建模努力旨在创建一个足够好的通用模型，可以适应各种领域，避免进行极不准确的预测。它们大多描述其模型为深度学习和传统统计模型的混合使用。然而，由于该服务最终是一个黑盒子，难以理解可能导致预测错误的原因，甚至很难事后调查如何改进预测。这意味着预测的质量水平相当高，但可能也存在性能上限。
- en: This service can be valuable for companies that need many forecasts but do not
    have the personnel available to generate them individually. However, for companies
    that have substantial amounts of historical data where more general heuristics
    and “laws” of their data could be discovered, it’s likely that an analyst could
    outperform these algorithms given familiarity with the domain.

    In this case we are not talking about the need for many parallel forecasts of
    the large number of metrics that affect the company’s business, but rather core

    demand for car rides, and Amazon has developed a well-regarded [autoregressive
    recurrent neural network](https://perma.cc/UL77-BY3T), inspired by statistical
    thinking for making predictions about product demands. The more that researchers
    are able to integrate statistical methodologies, such as the injection of priors

- en: However, making reasonably interpretable deep learning models—so that we can
    know just how “wrong” or extreme a forecast can be—remains a difficult endeavor,
    so it’s unlikely that traditional statistical models, with greater theoretical
    understanding and mechanistic clarity, will be discarded. For critical forecasts,
    where health and safety may be at risk, people reasonably may continue to rely
    on what has worked for decades until more transparent and inspectable methods
    can be developed for machine learning forecasts.

    your problem sets behind long ago with no desire to prove things, you needn’t
    fear a return of proper proofs and the like. On the other hand, this is a worrying
    trend as these technologies make their way into more and more fundamental aspects
    of life. I don’t mind surfing a retailer’s website that uses machine learning

    of statistical models but then using a gradient boosted tree (`XGBoost`) to choose
    the relative weightings of each model in the ensemble. In this example we see
    two distinctive ways machine learning and statistical approaches can be combined:
