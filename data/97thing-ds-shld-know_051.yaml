- en: It is well known that data science tools are becoming more “democratized,” or
    distributed more broadly within organizations to roles that not too long ago had
    to request analysis rather than perform it themselves. These tools are getting
    more sophisticated in terms of particular analysis techniques, the ability to
    connect to data sources of many kinds, and the ability to share data with people
    inside the organization and beyond. A primary reason that data science tools can
    be democratized broadly in organizations, even though they are becoming more powerful
    and sophisticated, is that the developers of the tools are able to successfully
    hide their complexity from the end users (until a user needs to peel back the
    layers for specific reasons).

  zh: 数据科学工具变得越来越“民主化”，或者说在组织内部更广泛地分布给那些不久前只能请求分析而不是自己执行分析的角色，这一点众所周知。这些工具在特定分析技术、连接多种数据来源的能力以及与组织内外的人分享数据的能力方面变得更加复杂和精密。数据科学工具之所以能够广泛在组织中民主化，尽管它们变得更加强大和复杂，主要原因在于工具的开发者能够成功地向最终用户隐藏其复杂性（直到用户因特定原因需要剥开层层）。
- en: The combination of hidden complexity and sophisticated analyses introduces some
    risks when the data analysis is driving decision making. In a much-too-simple
    analogy, we trust users to utilize calculators because they are familiar with
    and knowledgeable about basic arithmetic. What happens when the analysis capability
    is available at the click of a button but the end user does not understand the
    “arithmetic”? It can potentially open the door to analyses using the wrong techniques,
    violating key assumptions, and presenting results that are misleading—all of which
    can lead to suboptimal or incorrect decisions. What happens when those incorrect
    decisions affect employees, customers, or other constituents unfairly?

  zh: 隐藏的复杂性和复杂的分析方法的结合，在数据分析驱动决策时引入了一些风险。用一个过于简单的类比来说，我们信任用户使用计算器，因为他们熟悉和了解基本算术。当分析能力可以在点击一个按钮的情况下获得，但最终用户却不理解“算术”时，会发生什么？这可能会打开使用错误技术、违反关键假设并呈现误导性结果的分析的大门，所有这些都可能导致次优或错误的决策。当这些错误决策不公平地影响员工、客户或其他相关人员时，会发生什么？
- en: Generally, this risk is not as high when dealing in the realm of descriptive
    statistics and data visualization. However, it can become more problematic when
    the analysis relies more heavily on statistics, algorithms, machine learning,
    and artificial intelligence. In other words, the level of risk is not uniform
    when deploying data science tools within the organization. What is the level of
    responsibility for the analyst and decision makers when they are blind to the
    methods yielding the results? What are some ways that risk can be mitigated when
    underlying complexity is high and ease of use is high?

  zh: 一般来说，在描述性统计和数据可视化领域处理时，这种风险并不太高。然而，当分析更多地依赖于统计学、算法、机器学习和人工智能时，问题可能变得更加棘手。换句话说，在组织内部部署数据科学工具时，风险的水平并不一致。当分析方法对决策者和决策者来说是盲目的时，他们的责任是多少？在基础复杂性高而易用性也高的情况下，有哪些方式可以减轻风险？
- en: The first avenue is to emphasize continuous education. As generations of tools
    develop, it is critical for the training and education arms of the organization
    and universities to cover not only the use and functionality of the tools but
    also the limitations, assumptions, and pitfalls of various analysis methods. Without
    continuous education at the end user level, analyses will be wrong—though perhaps
    only intermittently—and that will undermine the data-driven decision efforts within
    organizations. If I do not know which analyses I can trust because they are sound
    fundamentally, use reliable data, and do not violate the assumptions of the techniques,
    how can I trust any of the analyses?

  zh: 第一条途径是强调持续教育。随着工具一代又一代的发展，组织和大学的培训教育部门不仅需要覆盖工具的使用和功能，还需要覆盖各种分析方法的限制、假设和潜在风险。在最终用户层面没有持续的教育，分析可能是错误的——尽管可能只是间歇性的——这将破坏组织内数据驱动决策的努力。如果我不知道哪些分析我可以信任，因为它们在根本上是正确的，使用可靠的数据，并且不违反技术的假设，那我怎么能信任任何分析呢？
- en: The second avenue is to use the software to monitor assumptions, make recommendations
    based on known technique limitations, and notify end users when an analysis may
    be vulnerable. For instance, does my dataset provide too much statistical power,
    and do inferences need to be validated in other ways? Does my data violate normality
    requirements? Embedded warning systems not only have the effect of mitigating
    risks arising from different kinds of analysis but also serve to let end users
    know what areas they need more knowledge about.

  zh: 第二种方法是利用软件来监控假设，根据已知技术限制提出建议，并在分析可能存在漏洞时通知最终用户。例如，我的数据集是否提供了过多的统计功效，推断是否需要以其他方式验证？我的数据是否违反正态性要求？嵌入式警告系统不仅有助于减轻不同分析所带来的风险，还能告知最终用户他们需要进一步了解的领域。
- en: It is critical for organizations to understand the level of knowledge needed
    to operate competently, ethically, and responsibly at various levels of sophistication.
    Without the dedication to knowledge that is appropriate for the types of analyses,
    the organization will be at risk of undermining faith in decision making, making
    decisions that impact constituents negatively, or even coming into conflict with
    organizational values. There may be other techniques to mitigate the risks that
    come with democratizing data science tools within organizations, but it is clear
    that the advancing capabilities of these tools require continual knowledge building
    within analysts, within software, or ideally within both.

  zh: 组织理解在各种复杂程度的层次上运营所需的知识水平至关重要，这涉及到能够胜任、遵守伦理和责任地工作。如果没有适合分析类型所需的知识投入，组织可能会面临破坏决策信任、对相关方产生负面影响的决策，甚至与组织价值观相冲突的风险。在组织内推广数据科学工具可能存在其他技术手段来减轻风险，但显然，这些工具不断进步的能力要求分析师、软件开发人员或最理想情况下两者都持续进行知识建设。
