    be a complete impossibility (the data doesn’t exist to augment the additional
    feature requests, the data isn’t granular enough to solve the request, or improving

    adjust the predictions so that you don’t see multiple pairs of sandals right next
    to one another” is perfectly fine. But if the problem is of an intensely complex
    nature, “I really don’t want to see bohemian maxi dresses next to grunge shoes”
    (hopefully, you will be able to quickly search what those terms mean during the

    “We looked into that, and since we don’t have data that declares what style these
    shoes are, we would have to build a CNN model, train it to recognize styles, and
    create the hundreds of thousands of labels needed to identify these styles across
    our product catalog. That would likely take several years to build.” or “We looked

    updating as planned through navigation, and validation of functionality on different
