- en: When considering the capture, processing, or use of data, companies are instructed
    to ask themselves, “Is this ethical?” The implication in the framing of the question
    is that the answer is either “yes” or “no.” In many cases, that is fine, but in
    many more cases, the answer is not nearly as cut and dried as the question implies.

  zh: 在考虑数据的捕获、处理或使用时，公司被要求问自己，“这是否道德？” 问题的框架暗示答案只能是“是”或“否”。在许多情况下，这是可以的，但在更多情况下，答案并不像问题所暗示的那样明确。

    knowledge and then to sell that data to multiple third parties for use in targeted
    marketing?* No.'

    then, if they do not opt out, to track their behavior and use that data to market
    to them with targeted banner ads on other sites as they browse the internet?*

- en: In the case of regulations like the GDPR in the EU, this sort of tracking would
    be a clear regulatory violation and could subject the organization to a sizable
    fine. But a regulatory violation does not necessarily make it unethical. (It is
    also a violation of GDPR to prevent someone from accessing a website if they do
    not consent to being tracked; a case could be made that this would be perfectly
    ethical—the company incurs costs to create and maintain a website, so the company
    should be able to place whatever constraints it wants on allowing access to that
    content—but this would in actuality be a regulatory violation.)

  zh: 就像欧盟的 GDPR 规定一样，这种追踪行为可能构成明显的违规，并可能使组织面临巨额罚款。但违规并不一定意味着不道德。（阻止某人访问网站，如果他们不同意被追踪也违反了
    GDPR；可以认为这是完全合乎道德的——公司需要投入成本来创建和维护网站，因此公司应该可以在允许访问内容时施加任何限制——但实际上这也是违规的。）

- en: 'One person, or a large group of people, may be entirely unconcerned with being
    tracked, may be annoyed by “consent” pop-ups that have to be responded to when
    visiting a website, and may prefer to have advertising presented to them that
    is more relevant than ads simply targeted at a mass population. (“I would rather
    see an ad for hiking gear, as I like to hike, than to see an ad for diapers, since
    my kids have been out of diapers for over a decade.”) This person or group would
    see the hypothetical “opt out” scenario as entirely ethical: it gives them what
    they want (a website-browsing experience with fewer interruptions and more relevant
    ads) at a low “cost” (organizations collecting data regarding their behavior without
    their explicit consent).'

  zh: 一个人或一大群人可能完全不介意被追踪，可能讨厌访问网站时需要回应“同意”弹窗，并可能更喜欢看到与其相关的广告，而不是简单针对大众的广告。（“我宁愿看到一则关于登山装备的广告，因为我喜欢登山，而不是看到尿布广告，因为我的孩子已经十多年没用尿布了。”）这个人或群体会认为假设的“选择退出”场景完全符合道德：它给了他们想要的东西（少打扰的网站浏览体验和更相关的广告），代价低廉（组织在未经他们明确同意的情况下收集关于他们行为的数据）。
- en: 'Another group of people may hold a completely different view: they do not trust
    corporations to collect, store, and use any form of data about them. They *want*
    to be informed any time they are going to be tracked, and they want to have the
    opportunity to explicitly allow or disallow that tracking (and not just the tracking,
    but also the current and future use of any data that is collected). For this group,
    the “opt out” scenario is clearly *unethical*.'

  zh: 另一组人可能持有完全不同的观点：他们不相信公司会收集、存储和使用任何形式的关于他们的数据。他们**希望**在任何跟踪之前得到通知，并且希望有机会明确允许或禁止该跟踪（不仅仅是跟踪，还包括收集的任何数据的当前和未来使用）。对于这个群体而言，“选择退出”显然是*不道德*的。
- en: 'This ambiguity crops up again and again in the real world when it comes to
    making decisions about data collection and use: the answer to the question “Is
    this ethical?” will differ based on who is asked and how they are asked. The classic
    litmus test for a data ethics decision is, “If what we are doing or planning to
    do with this data were to be published on the front page of the *New York Times*,
    would it cause negative PR for the company?” The reality is that there is almost
    no collection of data that would entirely pass *or* entirely fail this test: human
    beings are complex creatures with complicated feelings about the data they generate
    and the organizations that can capture and use it.'

  zh: 当涉及数据收集和使用决策时，这种模糊性在现实世界中一再出现：对于问题“这是否符合伦理？”，答案将根据询问者和询问方式而异。数据伦理决策的经典试金石是，“如果我们对这些数据的处理或计划公开在*纽约时报*的头版，会否对公司造成负面公关影响？”事实上，几乎没有任何数据收集可以完全通过*或*完全不通过这一测试：人类是复杂的生物，对于他们产生的数据及能够捕获和使用这些数据的组织有复杂的感受。
