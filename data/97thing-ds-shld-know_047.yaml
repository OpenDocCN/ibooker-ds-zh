- en: It is obvious that there is no data science without data. For societal improvements,
    the most useful data is generated by and/or based on humans. There are many factors
    that affect the use of such data, such as the need for privacy, the motivation
    for analysis, and the benefits of shared collective data. For the purpose of this
    essay, we will assume that the term “shared data” represents the data that combines
    data entries produced by and/or based on multiple humans, as opposed to data that
    represents one individual.

  zh: 显而易见，没有数据就没有数据科学。对于社会改进来说，最有用的数据是由人类生成和/或基于的数据。有许多因素会影响这类数据的使用，例如隐私的需求、分析的动机以及共享集体数据的好处。在本文中，我们将假定术语“共享数据”代表的是由多个人类生成的数据条目组合的数据，而不是代表一个个体的数据。
- en: Often in contemporary discussions about human-related data, the issue of privacy
    is perceived as its own issue, more worthy of attention than other relevant issues.
    This state of affairs, where privacy is considered in isolation from all other
    issues, is an obstacle to progress in the societally beneficial use of data. There
    is no doubt that serious improvements in areas such as health care, education,
    and environmental protection, among others, would be possible if skilled data
    scientists with good intentions had access to more relevant data.

  zh: 在当代关于人类相关数据的讨论中，隐私问题被视为一个独立的问题，比其他相关问题更值得关注。这种情况，即将隐私孤立考虑而不与所有其他问题一起考虑，是阻碍在社会上有益地使用数据的进展的障碍。毫无疑问，如果具有良好意图的熟练数据科学家能够访问更多相关数据，那么在健康保健、教育和环境保护等领域的显著改进是可能的。
- en: The issues of privacy and the issues of the use of shared data are treated very
    differently, depending on the motivation for data analysis as well as the ability
    to leverage the privilege of ownership. In the case of analysis in the for-profit
    sector (such as retail, banking, or telecom), where the motivation for analysis
    is largely the desire to sell more goods and services and maximize profit, the
    large players (such as Amazon) have access to vast amounts of customer-generated
    data that belongs to them. These dominant players are more or less free to use
    this data for the purpose of generating profit as they see fit.

  zh: 根据数据分析的动机以及利用所有权特权的能力，隐私问题和共享数据使用问题的处理方式有很大不同。在以盈利为目的的行业分析中（如零售、银行或电信），分析的动机主要是希望销售更多商品和服务以及最大化利润，这些主要玩家（如亚马逊）可以访问大量属于他们的客户生成数据。这些主导玩家在使用这些数据以实现他们认为合适的利润目的方面，更或多或少地自由。
- en: On the other hand, in areas that are traditionally not profit-driven but oriented
    toward larger societal benefits, and where the data is generated by a large number
    of stakeholders, such as in education, health care, and public policy, the situation
    is different. For example, let’s take a look at the area of health care.

  zh: 另一方面，在传统上不以盈利为导向而以更大社会效益为导向的领域中，数据由众多利益相关者生成，如教育、医疗和公共政策，情况就不同了。例如，让我们来看看医疗领域。
- en: 'It is almost certain that numerous health conditions or diseases that are currently
    untreatable, incurable, or undetected for long periods of time could actually
    be remedied if data scientists were provided proper data and were allowed to use
    proper methods with such data. Consider the following scenario: a large health
    care system collects and stores a large amount of data for each of its hundreds
    of thousands of patients, with data spanning years and/or decades. The system’s
    patients generate thousands of data points from numerous checkups, blood tests,
    administered medications, and so on. As a result, this health care system has
    terabytes of detailed health data about individual patients. Given unimpeded access
    to this entire dataset, data scientists working together with medical researchers
    in fields such as epidemiology or oncology would undoubtedly discover previously
    unknown patterns that could result in new medical discoveries and treatments.
    Due to many factors, though, this scenario is by and large not likely within US
    health care systems. One of the main obstacles to this potential achievement is
    regulation that does not account for the interplay of privacy and other societal
    benefits.'

  zh: 几乎可以肯定，目前无法治愈、无法治愈或长时间未被检测到的许多健康状况或疾病，如果数据科学家得到适当的数据并允许使用适当的方法，实际上可以得到治疗。考虑以下场景：一个大型医疗系统为数十万患者收集并存储大量数据，这些数据涵盖数年甚至几十年。该系统的患者通过多次检查、血液检测、服药等产生数千个数据点。因此，这家医疗系统拥有关于个体患者的详细健康数据的几个TB。如果能够毫无阻碍地访问整个数据集，数据科学家与流行病学或肿瘤学等医学研究人员合作，无疑会发现以前未知的模式，可能导致新的医学发现和治疗方法。然而，由于许多因素，这种情况在美国医疗系统中很大程度上是不可能的。这一潜在成就的主要障碍之一是法规未能考虑隐私与其他社会利益之间的相互作用。
- en: As a consequence, we find ourselves in a world in which Amazon can easily use
    your own data, combined with the data of millions of other shoppers, to motivate
    you to buy more stuff. At the same time, your physician is not allowed/enabled/incentivized
    to benefit from data science and compare your blood test data with that of millions
    of other individuals, possibly resulting in the early detection of a medical problem
    that would otherwise be impossible to detect with existing diagnostic methods.
    Similar examples exist in other areas such as education, urban planning, and environmental
    protections.

  zh: 由于这一结果，我们发现自己处于一个世界中，在这个世界中，亚马逊可以轻易地使用你的个人数据，结合数百万其他购物者的数据，来激励你购买更多商品。与此同时，你的医生却无法利用数据科学，比较你的血液检测数据与数百万其他个体的数据，可能导致早期发现一种其他诊断方法无法发现的医疗问题。类似的例子在教育、城市规划和环境保护等其他领域也存在。
- en: The time has come to take a look at all the factors affecting the use of personal,
    individual data and to develop new legal and organizational frameworks that account
    for how those factors relate to each other. If this development does not happen,
    progress and discoveries may occur elsewhere, possibly in a place that already
    has a growing army of highly trained data scientists, more data than anyone, and
    a center of power that can arbitrarily decide how to use it. Such discoveries
    would be less likely to be shared with broader humanity than if they originated
    in free and open societies that understood how to provide societal benefits from
    data science.

  zh: 现在是时候审视影响个人数据使用的所有因素，并制定新的法律和组织框架，考虑这些因素如何相互关联。如果这种发展不发生，进步和发现可能会发生在其他地方，可能是已经拥有数量庞大的高度训练的数据科学家团队、比任何人都要多的数据以及可以任意决定如何使用数据的权力中心的地方。这样的发现不太可能与更广泛的人类分享，与其源自理解如何从数据科学中获得社会利益的自由开放社会相比。
