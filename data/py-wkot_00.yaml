- en: In many ways, learning a programming language is like learning a foreign (human)
    language. You can take a course, understand the subject, and even do well on the
    final exam. But when it comes time to actually use the language, you can find
    yourself flustered, unsure of just what syntax to use, or what’s the most appropriate
    way to phrase something—let alone be unable to understand native speakers.

  zh: 在许多方面，学习一门编程语言就像学习一门外语（人类语言）。你可以上一门课程，理解主题，甚至在期末考试中表现良好。但当真正使用这门语言的时候，你可能会感到困惑，不确定该使用什么语法，或者如何最恰当地表达某个想法——更不用说无法理解母语者了。
- en: That’s where practice comes in. Practicing a foreign language gives you greater
    fluency and confidence, allowing you to engage in deeper and more interesting
    conversations. Practicing Python allows you to solve problems more quickly and
    easily, while simultaneously writing more readable and maintainable code. The
    improvement happens over time, as you use the language in new and varied situations.
    It often isn’t obvious that you have improved. And yet, when you look back to
    how you were using the language just a few months before, the difference is stark.

  zh: 这就是实践的作用。练习一门外语会给你带来更高的流利度和信心，让你能够参与更深入、更有趣的对话。练习Python将让你能够更快、更轻松地解决问题，同时编写更易读和易于维护的代码。随着时间的推移，随着你在新的和多样化的情境中使用语言，这种改进会发生。你往往不会意识到自己已经有所改进。然而，当你回顾几个月前自己使用语言的方式时，差异是明显的。
- en: This book isn’t meant to teach you Python. Rather, it’s meant to give you the
    practice you need to achieve greater fluency. After going through the exercises
    in this book—not just skimming through the questions and peeking at the answers—you
    will write more readable, more idiomatic, and more maintainable Python code.

    Python training classes. Once the course was over, they often asked where they
    could get additional practice, to continue improving their skills. This book draws

- en: 'The exercises are designed to help you internalize some of the core ideas in
    Python: core data structures, functions, comprehensions, object-oriented programming,
    and iterators. These might seem like simple topics, perhaps even too simple for
    a book of exercises. But all of Python, from the largest application to the smallest
    script, is based on these building blocks. Knowing them well is a crucial part
    of being a fluent Python developer. I often say that ignoring these building blocks
    in favor of more complex topics is akin to a chemistry student ignoring the elements
    in favor of “real” chemicals.'

  zh: 这些练习旨在帮助你内化Python的一些核心思想：核心数据结构、函数、列表推导式、面向对象编程和迭代器。这些可能看起来像是简单的话题，也许甚至对于一本练习书来说过于简单。但Python的每一个部分，从最大的应用到最小的脚本，都是基于这些构建块。对这些构建块有深入的了解是成为一名熟练的Python开发者的关键部分。我经常说，忽视这些构建块而偏爱更复杂的话题，就像化学学生忽视元素而偏爱“真实”的化学物质一样。
- en: I can personally attest to the power of practice, not just as a Python instructor,
    but also as a student. For several years, I’ve been learning Chinese, in no small
    part because I travel to China every few months to teach Python courses there.
    Each lesson that I take, and every exercise that I do, doesn’t seem to advance
    my fluency very much. But when I return to China after an absence of several months,
    I find that the practice has indeed helped, and that I’m able to communicate more
    easily with the locals.

- en: This book contains many examples of source code both in numbered listings and
    in line with normal text. In both cases, source code is formatted in a `fixed-width
    font` `like` `this` to separate it from ordinary text. Sometimes code is also
    in bold to highlight code that has changed from previous steps in the chapter,
    such as when a new feature adds to an existing line of code.

  zh: 本书包含许多源代码示例，既有编号列表，也有与普通文本混排。在这两种情况下，源代码都使用 `固定宽度字体` `像这样` 格式化，以将其与普通文本区分开来。有时代码也会加粗，以突出显示与章节中先前步骤相比已更改的代码，例如当新功能添加到现有代码行时。
- en: In many cases, the original source code has been reformatted; we’ve added line
    breaks and reworked indentation to accommodate the available page space in the
    book. In rare cases, even this was not enough, and listings include line-continuation
    markers (*➥*). Additionally, comments in the source code have often been removed
    from the listings when the code is described in the text. Code annotations accompany
    many of the listings, highlighting important concepts.

    code (in print), explanation, Python Tutor link, downloadable code, `pytest` tests,
    and screencasts will help you to fully understand each solution and apply its
    lessons to your own code.

    You can download and install it most easily from [https://python.org/](https://python.org/).

    ways to install Python, including the Windows Store or Homebrew for the Mac.

    of places, the text describes features that are new in Python 3.7 and 3.8, but
    the solutions all use techniques that work with 3.6\. The programs all work across
    operating systems, so no matter what platform you’re using, the exercises in this
    book will work.

- en: You don’t technically need to install an editor or IDE (integrated development
    environment) for Python, but it’ll certainly come in handy. Two of the most popular
    IDEs are PyCharm (from JetBrains) and VSCode (from Microsoft). Older and/or more
    traditional Python developers use vim or Emacs (my personal favorite). But at
    the end of the day, you can and should use whichever editor works best for you.
    Python doesn’t really care what version you’re using.

  zh: 关于封面插图
- en: The figure on the cover of Python Workout is captioned “Homme de la Terre de
    Feu,” or “A man from the Tierra del Fuego.” The illustration is taken from a collection
    of dress costumes from various countries by Jacques Grasset de Saint-Sauveur (1757–1810),
    titled Costumes civils actuel de tous les peoples connus, published in France
    in 1784\. Each illustration is finely drawn and colored by hand. The rich variety
    of Grasset de Saint-Sauveur’s collection reminds us vividly of how culturally
    apart the world’s towns and regions were just 200 years ago. Isolated from each
    other, people spoke different dialects and languages. In the streets or in the
    countryside, it was easy to identify where they lived and what their trade or
    station in life was just by their dress.

  zh: Python Workout的封面上的插图标题为“Homme de la Terre de Feu”，或“火地岛的人”。这幅插图取自雅克·格拉塞·德·圣索沃尔（1757–1810）的作品集，名为《Costumes
    civils actuel de tous les peoples connus》，1784年在法国出版。每一幅插图都是手工精心绘制和着色的。格拉塞·德·圣索沃尔收藏中的丰富多样性生动地提醒我们，200年前世界的城镇和地区在文化上有多么不同。人们彼此孤立，说着不同的方言和语言。在街道或乡村，仅凭他们的服装就能轻易识别他们居住的地方以及他们的职业或社会地位。
- en: The way we dress has changed since then and the diversity by region, once so
    rich, has faded away. It’s now hard to distinguish the inhabitants of different
    continents, let alone different towns, regions, or countries. Perhaps we have
    traded cultural diversity for a more varied personal life—certainly for a more
    varied and fast-paced technological life.
