- en: When the topic of data science and ethics is discussed, data privacy and bias
    in machine learning are often at the forefront of people’s concerns. It can be
    unsettling to think that your personal data could be misused by companies, or
    that algorithms could perpetuate race-, gender-, or age-based biases. However,
    if we step back and evaluate the entire data life cycle, we find ethics can influence
    everything from how we collect data to how we use it to make decisions. A principled
    approach to analytics is needed at every stage in this data life cycle, including
    the “last mile” of analytics where key insights are shared or communicated with
    audiences.

  zh: 当讨论数据科学和伦理问题时，数据隐私和机器学习中的偏见常常是人们关注的焦点。想到个人数据可能会被公司误用，或者算法可能会持续种族、性别或年龄偏见，这确实令人不安。然而，如果我们退后一步，评估整个数据生命周期，我们会发现伦理可以影响从数据收集到如何使用它做出决策的方方面面。在数据生命周期的每个阶段，包括与观众分享或传达关键见解的“最后一英里”，都需要一种基于原则的分析方法。
- en: As the need to convey insights to others in an effective manner has grown, many
    people have shown interest in *data storytelling,* in which key insights are visualized
    and presented in a compelling narrative format. However, some data professionals
    are still skeptical and uncomfortable with storytelling’s role in communicating
    findings. Stories are often associated with entertainment, fiction, and fluff—leaving
    some people to view storytelling as subjective and superficial. Others may recognize
    the persuasive power of narrative but feel it can compromise the integrity of
    the facts. For these reasons, some individuals prefer to leave the facts alone
    and not taint them with any narrative treatments.

  zh: 随着有效传达见解的需求增加，许多人对“数据叙事”表现出兴趣，其中关键见解被视觉化并以引人入胜的叙事形式呈现。然而，一些数据专业人士仍对叙事在传达发现中的角色持怀疑态度并感到不适。故事常与娱乐、虚构和废话联系在一起，这使得一些人将叙事视为主观和肤浅。其他人可能认识到叙事的说服力，但认为它可能会损害事实的完整性。因此，一些人更愿意让事实保持原样，不带入任何叙述性处理。
- en: Despite the general tendency to believe “facts can speak for themselves,” they
    often don’t. Raw logic and reason frequently fail to engage people and inspire
    them to act. For this reason, many valuable insights are misunderstood, ignored,
    and forgotten. Interestingly, the human brain has been conditioned to seek out
    and respond to narrative. As social psychologist Jonathan Haidt states, “The human
    mind is a story processor, not a logic processor.” Neuroscientists such as USC
    professor Antonio Damasio have also discovered that emotion plays a significant
    role in decision making. Effective data storytelling can form a bridge between
    logic and emotion, helping an audience to not only hear your statistics but also
    feel them as well.

  zh: 尽管人们普遍倾向于相信“事实可以说明问题”，事实往往并非如此。纯粹的逻辑和理性通常不能吸引人们并激励他们采取行动。因此，许多宝贵的洞见被误解、忽视和遗忘。有趣的是，人类大脑已经被条件化为寻找并回应故事。正如社会心理学家乔纳森·海德特所说，“人类思维是处理故事的器官，而非逻辑处理器。”
    神经科学家如南加州大学教授安东尼奥·达马西奥也发现情感在决策中起到重要作用。有效的数据叙事可以在逻辑和情感之间架起桥梁，帮助听众不仅听到你的统计数据，还能感受到它们。
- en: 'Storytelling with data helps us to share insights more effectively, but it
    must be done in a responsible, ethical manner. We need not only more data storytellers
    but also ethical ones who share their data stories with integrity. To be an ethical
    data storyteller, you’ll want to be mindful of the following principles:'

  zh: 用数据讲故事有助于更有效地分享见解，但必须以负责任和道德的方式进行。我们不仅需要更多的数据叙事者，还需要那些以诚信分享数据故事的道德叙事者。要成为道德数据叙事者，你需要牢记以下原则：

- en: Data is the foundation of every data story. You want to do everything in your
    power to verify that the numbers are accurate and can be trusted. While no one
    can guarantee the exactness of every data point, an ethical data storyteller will
    be thorough in their pursuit of truth and strive to provide trustworthy, directionally
    sound insights.

- en: Whenever you form a data story, you need to be mindful of potential cognitive
    biases, such as confirmation bias, that may negatively influence your analysis.
    You also want to be careful to not let faulty reasoning, such as interpreting
    correlation as causation, undermine your conclusions. While it may be difficult
    for fallible human beings to completely avoid biases and fallacies, an ethical
    data storyteller will seek to be as objective and rigorous as possible with their
    analyses and reasoning.

  zh: 每当你构建一个数据故事时，你需要注意潜在的认知偏见，比如确认偏见，可能会对你的分析产生负面影响。你也需要小心，不要让错误的推理，比如把相关性误解为因果关系，损害你的结论。虽然对于可犯错误的人类来说完全避免偏见和谬误可能很困难，但一个道德的数据讲述者会尽可能客观和严谨地进行分析和推理。

- en: When you start with a desired narrative to prove a point or support a decision,
    you compromise the integrity of your data story. You’ll be tempted to select only
    data points that strengthen your desired narrative and ignore ones that don’t.
    When the destination of a data story is predetermined, the data and narrative
    will often be constrained and prejudiced. An ethical data storyteller will develop
    the narrative only after they have analyzed the data—not before—to preserve the
    integrity of the insights they share. When the data is approached with an open
    mind, it may take you to unexpected but beneficial places.

  zh: 当你从一个希望的叙述开始来证明一个观点或支持一个决定时，你就会损害你的数据故事的完整性。你会倾向于选择只有增强你所期望叙述的数据点，并忽略那些不支持的数据点。当数据故事的目的已经确定时，数据和叙述通常会受到限制和偏见的约束。一个道德的数据讲述者会在分析数据之后才开发叙述，以保持分享见解的完整性。当以开放的心态处理数据时，它可能会带你走向意想不到但有益的地方。

- en: The goal of using data visualizations in your data stories is to help the audience
    clearly understand your insights. Depending on the data you choose to include
    in a chart or how you decide to visualize it, you can misrepresent or distort
    your findings—inadvertently or purposefully. For example, valuable contextual
    data that shows seasonality could be left out, or the size or slope of a trend
    could be accentuated by adjusting the scale of the y-axis. An ethical data storyteller
    is disciplined in how they visualize their data so their charts are communicative,
    not deceptive or manipulative.

  zh: 使用数据可视化在你的数据故事中的目标是帮助观众清楚地理解你的见解。根据你选择包含在图表中的数据或者你决定如何可视化它，你可能会无意或有意地误传或扭曲你的发现。例如，有价值的展示季节性的上下文数据可能会被忽略，或者通过调整y轴的比例来夸大趋势的大小或斜率。一个道德的数据讲述者在可视化数据时会有纪律性，确保他们的图表是沟通的，而不是欺骗性或操纵性的。
- en: When you strive to craft and tell data stories in an ethical manner, you build
    your credibility as a data storyteller. The care and attention you put into being
    ethical with your data narratives helps you establish a relationship with your
    key stakeholders. You become a trusted advisor and guide for them through the
    numbers and charts. When the goal is to have other people understand, trust, and
    act on your insights, being ethical with your data stories isn’t merely admirable—it’s
    essential to your success as a data storyteller.

  zh: 当你努力以道德方式创作和讲述数据故事时，你就在建立自己作为数据讲述者的信誉。你在处理数据叙述时的关注和细心，帮助你与关键利益相关者建立关系。你成为他们通过数字和图表理解、信任和行动的可信顾问和向导。当目标是让其他人理解、信任和采纳你的见解时，以道德方式处理数据故事不仅仅是令人钦佩的，而且对于你作为数据讲述者的成功至关重要。
