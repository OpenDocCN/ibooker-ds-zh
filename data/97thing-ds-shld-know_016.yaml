- en: 'In my other piece for this book, I address the responsibility of the corporate
    side when it comes to addressing the work culture that creates these types of
    ethical issues. This led me to wonder: how can we instill more ethical consideration
    into the data science community at large to prevent these types of disasters?'

  zh: 在本书的另一篇文章中，我讨论了企业在处理造成这些类型伦理问题的工作文化时的责任。这使我想知道：我们如何能够在数据科学社区中灌输更多的伦理考量，以防止这些灾难的发生？
- en: Ethics has long been part of the curriculum for those pursuing finance degrees
    and MBAs more generally, and in the past few years especially, we’ve seen more
    of these courses in data science master’s programs and even in online learning
    programs. In my view, to address the growing ethical quandaries that this age
    of seemingly boundless personal data provides us with, ethics needs to be made
    a cornerstone of any quantitative learning program, including traditional academic
    degrees, data science boot camps, MOOCs (massive open online courses), and everything
    in between.

  zh: 长期以来，伦理一直是追求金融学位和MBA的课程的一部分，尤其是在过去几年中，我们在数据科学硕士课程甚至在线学习课程中看到了更多这类课程。在我看来，要解决这个似乎提供了无边界个人数据的时代带来的日益增多的伦理困境，伦理必须成为任何数量化学习项目的基石，包括传统学术学位、数据科学训练营、MOOC（大规模开放在线课程）等等。
- en: I know, I know. The math, statistics, and computer science curriculum for a
    data scientist is already overflowing, and the scope of learning is daunting.
    And I’m aware that adding more to the aspiring data scientist’s academic plate
    is a big ask. However, data scientists must develop an understanding of the bigger
    picture for projects that they’re working on, and of the ramifications their work
    may have for different groups. Algorithms that are not developed with existing
    social factors in mind can easily end up reinforcing the discriminatory practices
    that they might reveal if examined by a discerning data scientist. We’ve already
    seen how these situations can play out in notably sensitive areas such as health
    care, where privacy is paramount and access to care is not always equitable.

  zh: 我知道，我知道。对于数据科学家的数学、统计学和计算机科学课程已经很丰富了，学习的范围也很庞大。我也意识到，在雄心勃勃的数据科学家的学术板上再添加更多内容是一个很大的要求。然而，数据科学家必须对他们正在进行的项目有一个更大局的理解，以及他们的工作可能对不同群体产生的后果。如果算法在开发时没有考虑现有的社会因素，它们很容易会强化那些可能会被敏锐的数据科学家揭示出来的歧视性做法。我们已经看到了这些情况如何在健康护理等特别敏感的领域中发生，隐私至关重要，而对护理的访问并不总是公平的。
- en: 'Data ethics programs must also address current legislation and considerations
    for the collection of personal data: are people aware of what data is being collected?
    Do they know how their data is being used? Do they have an option to opt out?
    Is their data being responsibly stored and protected? Is their data being sold
    to third parties without their consent?'

  zh: 数据伦理项目还必须考虑目前的立法和对个人数据收集的考量：人们是否知道正在被收集哪些数据？他们知道他们的数据如何被使用吗？他们有选择退出的选项吗？他们的数据是否被负责地存储和保护？他们的数据是否未经他们同意而出售给第三方？
- en: Legislation in the digital age has been notably behind in this area, and in
    some cases this has led companies to simply ignore potential ethical ramifications
    because there are no existing laws. But for future generations of data scientists
    who will be tomorrow’s business leaders, instilling this responsibility and big-picture
    thinking into their learning curricula will teach them to start thinking about
    these problems from the very beginning.

  zh: 数字时代的立法在这一领域明显滞后，甚至在某些情况下，这导致公司简单地忽视潜在的伦理后果，因为法律还不存在。但对于明日商界领袖——数据科学家的后代来说，在他们的学习课程中灌输这种责任和大局思维，将教会他们从一开始就开始考虑这些问题。
- en: How can data scientists be expected to provide responsible analysis and insights
    to their companies if they are not taught how to consider all the potential angles
    in these situations? Even as laws and public opinions on privacy have evolved,
    they are certainly not keeping pace with the development of technology that can
    do great harm if left unchecked.

  zh: 如果我们不教会数据科学家如何考虑这些情况中的所有潜在角度，他们如何能够提供负责任的分析和见解给他们的公司呢？即使隐私法律和公众对隐私的看法已经发展，它们显然无法跟上技术发展的步伐，而这些技术如果不加控制可能会造成巨大的危害。
- en: Additionally, instilling these types of critical thinking skills in regard to
    ethics will give data scientists the information they need to make more informed
    decisions about how to direct company strategy. I’ve repeatedly said that those
    who have a well-developed understanding of analytics should be in charge of running
    companies, and that understanding should include how analytics can be used responsibly
    to further a business’s goals without opening the business up to potential scandal
    down the line.

  zh: 此外，灌输这些关于伦理的批判性思维技能将为数据科学家提供他们需要的信息，以便更明智地决策如何引导公司战略。我一再强调过，那些对分析有深入理解的人应该负责经营公司，而这种理解应包括如何负责地利用分析来推动企业的目标，而不会在未来暴露企业于潜在丑闻之中。
- en: As more of the world grows to depend on digital resources, the amount of data
    available for us to exploit is growing exponentially, and that growth shows no
    signs of stopping. I have no doubt that in five or ten years there will be even
    more ethical tangles for us to sort through, as we continue to integrate different
    data sources and find new ways to uncover the information we seek from data. Whether
    we navigate this process successfully will depend on whether quantitative professionals
    have been armed with the knowledge and ethical mindset necessary to critically
    evaluate the directions we’re taking every step of the way. Developing this base
    of knowledge must start with the data science curriculum.

  zh: 随着世界越来越依赖数字资源，我们可以利用的数据量正在呈指数增长，而这种增长没有任何停止的迹象。我毫不怀疑，在五到十年内，我们将面临更多伦理困境需要解决，因为我们继续整合不同的数据来源，并找到从数据中挖掘所需信息的新方法。我们能否成功地应对这一过程将取决于量化专业人士是否已经掌握了批判性评估我们每一步走向的知识和伦理心态。发展这一知识基础必须从数据科学课程开始。
