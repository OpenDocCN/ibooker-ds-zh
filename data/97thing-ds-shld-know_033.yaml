- en: Data analytics holds the promise of a more profound and complete understanding
    of the world around us. Many have claimed that because of the present-day ubiquity
    of data, it has become possible to finally automate everything from value creation
    to organizational adaptability. To achieve this, large quantities of data about
    people (and their behaviors) are required. But there is a balance to be struck
    between the need for this very detailed data and the rights of individuals to
    maintain their privacy. One approach to dealing with this challenge is to remove
    some of the key identifiers from a dataset, sometimes called the “name data,”
    which typically includes fields such as *Name*, *Address*, and *Social Security
    Number*. Those are the features that would appear to be the key characteristics
    that uniquely identify an individual. Unfortunately, there is a wide range of
    techniques that allows others to de-anonymize such data.

  zh: 数据分析承诺能更深入和全面地理解我们周围的世界。许多人声称，由于数据的普遍存在，现在可以从价值创造到组织适应性的所有过程最终实现自动化。为了实现这一目标，需要大量关于人们（及其行为）的数据。但是，在需要非常详细数据的需求与个体维护隐私权之间需要权衡。解决这一挑战的一种方法是从数据集中删除一些关键标识符，有时称为“名称数据”，通常包括*姓名*、*地址*和*社会安全号码*等字段。这些特征似乎是唯一标识个体的关键特征。不幸的是，存在广泛的技术可以让他人对此类数据进行反匿名化。
- en: Some datasets can be de-anonymized by very rudimentary means; for example, some
    individuals in a dataset of anonymous movie reviews were identified simply by
    searching for similarly worded reviews on websites that are not anonymous—IMDB,
    for example. In another case, AOL released a list of 20 million web search queries
    it had collected, and two reporters were able to uniquely identify an individual
    based on clues in their specific searches.

  zh: 一些数据集可以通过非常初级的手段进行反匿名化；例如，某些匿名电影评论数据集中的个体仅通过搜索非匿名网站上类似措辞的评论，如IMDB，就能被识别出来。在另一种情况下，AOL发布了一个包含2000万个网络搜索查询的列表，两名记者能够根据其特定搜索中的线索唯一地识别出个人。
- en: Beyond those simple approaches, a more complex approach is to explore the other
    fields that remain unchanged, so if the dataset has the name data removed, this
    could result in problems; for example, if a researcher is looking at the relationship
    between where someone lives and their level of health, removing the *Address*
    identifier would prove detrimental to the research. To address this issue, sometimes
    an *Area Code* parameter is left, and then the research can be successfully completed.
    However, a hacker can uniquely identify the individual records from a dataset
    that has the name data removed, but includes *Area Code* and other parameters,
    by incorporating existing publicly available data into the analysis, as shown
    by a number of computer scientists, most notably Latanya Sweeney, Director of
    the Data Privacy Lab at Harvard University.

  zh: 除了这些简单的方法外，一个更复杂的方法是探索其他未更改的字段，因此，如果数据集中的名称数据被移除，这可能会导致问题；例如，如果研究人员正在研究居住地与健康水平之间的关系，删除*地址*标识符将对研究产生不利影响。为了解决这个问题，有时会留下*区号*参数，然后研究可以成功完成。然而，黑客可以通过将现有的公开数据纳入分析中，从删除了名称数据但包含*区号*和其他参数的数据集中唯一地识别出个体记录，这一点由许多计算机科学家，特别是哈佛大学数据隐私实验室主任拉塔尼亚·斯温尼展示了。
- en: Anonymizing data in a social media (or networked) context is even more challenging,
    and it is worth noting that researchers are often more interested in the relationships
    between people rather than an individual’s data. Typically, a social network is
    represented as a graph, with nodes representing individuals or organizations,
    and the edges representing connections and communications between the individuals
    or organizations. So even if the anonymization of the data operates in essentially
    the same manner as before, by removing common identifiers, specifically the name
    data, all the hacker has to do is create a number of false individuals and use
    those to connect to existing individuals within the network (assuming the dataset
    represents a live system). After connecting to a small number of real individuals,
    it will be possible to uniquely identify them based on the configuration (shape)
    of the connections of each individual to others.

  zh: 在社交媒体（或网络）环境中对数据进行匿名化更具挑战性，值得注意的是，研究人员通常对人与人之间的关系更感兴趣，而不是个体的数据。通常情况下，社交网络被表示为一个图形，节点表示个人或组织，边表示个人或组织之间的连接和交流。因此，即使数据的匿名化操作基本上与以往相同，即通过移除常见标识符，特别是姓名数据，所有的黑客只需创建一些虚假的个体，并使用这些虚假个体连接到网络内现有的个体（假设数据集表示一个实时系统）。连接到少数真实个体后，就可以根据每个个体与其他人的连接配置（形状）来唯一识别它们。
- en: The poet Alexander Pope said, “How happy is the blameless vestal’s lot! The
    world forgetting, by the world forgot,” meaning that cloistered nuns have forgotten
    about the outside world, and the world reciprocates; this suggests that perhaps
    the only way to remain anonymous is to stay away from any services that would
    record data about you.

  zh: 诗人亚历山大·波普曾说过：“无罪贞女幸福何其大！遗世独立心自闲。”意思是禁闭修女们已经忘记了外界，而且外界也忘记了她们；这表明也许唯一保持匿名的方法是远离记录你数据的任何服务。
