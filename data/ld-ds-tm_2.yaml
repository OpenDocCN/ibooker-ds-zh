- en: Data science teams are a pretty busy bunch. There are constant requests for
    new reports, new models, and past analyses to be redone with new data. For most
    data science leaders, this means having to make thoughtful decisions around what
    to actually work on and what to deprioritize or not do entirely. It also makes
    it very important to manage how long tasks are taking because if one particular
    task takes longer than expected, something else has to be pushed back.

  zh: 数据科学团队非常忙碌。不断有新报告、新模型和以新数据重做的过去分析的请求。对于大多数数据科学领导者来说，这意味着必须要做出周到的决策，决定实际工作和次要工作或完全不做的事情。这也使得管理任务完成所需时间非常重要，因为如果某个任务花费的时间超出预期，其他事情就不得不推迟。
- en: To be able to successfully manage the workload of your team, you’ll first need
    to have a very clear view on what the goal of your team even is. Are you helping
    make the product better with machine learning, providing strategy advice with
    data to a particular department, or something else? You’ll then need a clear project
    management process for how to keep track of the work, and while data science is
    similar to software engineering, some software engineering principles, such as
    Agile, don’t always directly map to data science. You’ll also need to have clear
    communication with your stakeholders so that, as new developments arise, everyone
    has the information they need.

  zh: 要成功管理您团队的工作量，首先需要非常清晰地了解您团队的目标是什么。您是通过机器学习帮助改进产品，还是向特定部门提供数据策略建议，亦或是其他？然后，您需要一个清晰的项目管理流程来跟踪工作进展，虽然数据科学与软件工程相似，但是某些软件工程原则，比如敏捷开发，并不总是直接适用于数据科学。您还需要与利益相关者进行清晰的沟通，这样当新的进展出现时，每个人都有所需的信息。
- en: The task of managing the work of a data science team must be a concern for data
    science leaders on teams of all sizes. On smaller teams, the leader may do the
    project management tasks directly. On larger teams, there will be a project manager
    who is in charge of managing the tasks. But as the data science leader, you’ll
    still be responsible for the work actually getting finished, and when something
    goes wrong, it will be on you to fix it. So this chapter lays out how to think
    about managing the tasks of a data science group and best practices for keeping
    your team running smoothly.

    a data science team is that they focus on exactly one of these goals and one particular
    part of the organization to help with (like marketing). In practice, you’ll find
    your team often being drawn to do multiple goals, either from external stakeholders
    with unmet needs or from your own desire to have the team have more influence
    and bring data to new places. But unless your data science team is massive, with
    many data scientists and managers within it, it is unlikely you’ll be able to
    do it all.'

    to a product so that customers can interact with the product in a new way. Some
    tasks will likely not affect the business much. Even if you absolutely ace a forecast
    for revenue from a marketing channel, having that forecast probably won’t change
    much of your business. Interestingly, this question of how much value will come
    from the work isn’t a data science question—it doesn’t have to do with how you
    approach the task technically. Instead, thinking about value will require you,
    the data science leader, to possibly step outside your comfort zone and think
    from a product perspective.

    risky and fail in lots of ways. Before starting a project, it’s critically important
    that you as the data science leader take a guess as to how likely it is to succeed.
    This ideally would be done in collaboration with a principal data scientist. Having
    a reasonably thought-out idea of how well a project would work will help you decide
    if it’s worth doing. There can be a really wide range of risks for different data
    science projects: updating an existing report probably has a high chance of succeeding,
    whereas building an entirely new machine learning model on new data to use in
    a new product has much less of a chance.'

    more enjoyable for data scientists than others (it’s generally more fun to build
    a new model with an all-new method than retrain the same model for the hundredth
    time). In a perfect world, the tasks your team is working on align with the particular
    type of work the data scientists were specifically hired to do and with their
    particular interests. Not everything is going to be a data scientist’s dream to
    do, but if none of the work is fulfilling to them, you risk attrition.

- en: See [Table 2-1](#example_of_data_science_projects) for some examples of how
    different projects might score. Interestingly, these three questions are often
    highly correlated (or inversely correlated). There is often an inverse correlation
    between how much something could influence the business and how likely it is to
    be pulled off. For example, lots of stakeholders come to data science teams with
    a pipe dream project (we use machine learning to predict what flavor of ice cream
    a customer will order before they walk into the store!) that could be valuable
    but probably won’t work. The tasks that are very likely to work probably don’t
    have value. This often has to be the case because most tasks that would be straightforward

    like that. Those requirements then have to be converted into data science concepts;
    for example, “must always give customers the right answer” converts to a particular
    accuracy metric. If the stakeholder only tells you, the leader, about them, then
    you will have a hard time trying to explain the idea to your team and answer any
    particular questions the team has. In this case, you’re a bottleneck for the information
