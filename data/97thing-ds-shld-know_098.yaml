- en: Ethics in data and analytics is a critical field that fortunately is getting
    increased attention. From data aggregation firms that repeatedly demonstrate disregard
    of their data stewardship responsibilities to meet company objectives, to pandemic
    methodologies that invade individual privacy for the greater societal good, ethical
    paradoxes are seemingly everywhere.

  zh: 数据和分析伦理是一个关键领域，幸运的是，它正在得到越来越多的关注。从多次展示忽视数据管护责任以达成公司目标的数据聚合公司，到侵犯个人隐私以造福更大社会利益的流行病方法，伦理悖论似乎无处不在。
- en: Some technology firms have given the concept of data and analytics ethics serious
    consideration. Others put on a public show of creating a data ethics council,
    only to violate the articles of their own code of data ethics in that council’s
    creation. There are few public examples paving a path for data and analytics ethics.
    It seems the grown-ups have all left the room.

  zh: 一些科技公司认真考虑了数据和分析伦理的概念。其他公司公开展示创建数据伦理委员会，却违反了其自身数据伦理准则的条款。很少有公开的例子为数据和分析伦理铺平道路。似乎成年人都已离席。
- en: 'To be fair, organizations are often faced with ethical choices that can, in
    the minds of leaders, be seen as ethical paradoxes. But are they? Let’s consider
    a simple example: in early February a church treasurer receives a request from
    the pastor for a substantial donation. As a condition of accepting the gift, the
    pastor asks the treasurer, on behalf of the donor, to backdate the letter officially
    acknowledging the gift to December of the previous year. When confronted, the
    pastor said he saw it as an ethical dilemma. The choice was between more funds
    for the church to do good work versus the legality of the donor having a lower
    tax bill because everyone had “fudged” the timing.'

  zh: 说句公道话，组织经常面临可以在领导人看来被视为伦理悖论的伦理选择。但它们真的是吗？让我们考虑一个简单的例子：二月初，一位教堂财务主管收到牧师的一份请求，请求一笔大额捐款。作为接受礼物的条件，牧师要求财务主管代表捐赠者，将正式承认礼物的信函日期回溯到前一年的十二月。当面对质疑时，牧师称他认为这是伦理困境。选择是为了教堂获得更多资金以开展善工，还是捐赠者因为所有人都“捏造”了时间而获得更低的税单。
- en: This is *not* an ethical paradox, even though the pastor had convinced himself
    it was. It is not the choice between two diametrically opposed ethically appropriate
    decisions. Yes, the funds would have helped the church. Yet accepting the gift,
    however much we all may not like the IRS, was a clear violation of the tax code.
    In fact, if uncovered (and given the paper trail, that would have been easy),
    it could result in penalties, including the church losing its nonprofit status.

  zh: 这*不是*一个伦理悖论，尽管牧师已经说服自己是。这不是在两个截然对立的伦理适当决定之间的选择。是的，这些资金本来会帮助教堂。但是接受这份礼物，无论我们多么不喜欢国税局，都是明显违反税法的。事实上，如果被发现（鉴于书面记录，这将很容易），可能会导致处罚，包括教堂失去非营利性地位。
- en: These same types of false ethical paradoxes face business leaders daily. The
    vast majority of the time the right decision is made. But there are too many examples
    in which thinking becomes muddled and the decision makers create a paradox that
    doesn’t exist.

- en: A health care payer establishes a function to contribute to the research community
    based on their book of business. One study strongly suggests that higher CAP scores
    (an NCQA [National Committee for Quality Assurance] measurement of customer health
    plan satisfaction) are directly related to members with a higher risk burden (higher
    response rate and a direct correlation of higher satisfaction to increased use
    of health care services). So the research is not published, avoiding public scrutiny
    over that plan’s high satisfaction scores.

  zh: 一个健康保健支付者建立了一个基于其业务的研究社区贡献功能。一项研究强烈表明，更高的CAP分数（NCQA [全国质量保证委员会] 衡量客户健康计划满意度的指标）与承担更高风险负担的会员直接相关（更高的响应率和高满意度直接关联到健康保健服务的增加使用）。因此，该研究未公开发表，避免公众对该计划高满意度分数的审查。
- en: A project within a health organization pulls consumer data into models that
    assess a patient’s risk based on their buying habits. This could be an example
    of data used for good—a physician having information they can use to help guide
    a patient’s care based on their food purchases. However, that same information,
    if collected by a health plan, could be used to adjust future premiums, even pricing
    the product out of reach for that member/group as a way for the health plan to
    shed higher-risk customers.

  zh: 在一个健康组织内的一个项目将消费者数据输入模型，评估患者的风险基于他们的购买习惯。这可能是数据用于善良的一个例子——医生拥有他们可以使用的信息，以帮助指导患者的护理，基于他们的食品购买。然而，同样的信息，如果由健康计划收集，可以用来调整未来的保费，甚至将产品定价到该成员/群体无法承受的程度，作为健康计划为摆脱高风险客户而采取的手段。
- en: In an effort to improve an asthma-related HEDIS measure, a health plan embarks
    on a program for everyone classified in the HEDIS denominator (those classified
    as having asthma per NCQA definitions) to get a specific medication (controller),
    even though there was no question many members were false positives as a result
    of a challenged methodology. Concerns over higher-quality scores resulted in moving
    forward with the effort, including those that were false positives, with the justification
    that the unnecessary prescription would “not hurt them.”

  zh: 为了改善与哮喘相关的HEDIS指标，一个健康计划开始了一个项目，针对HEDIS分母中被归类为哮喘的每个人（根据NCQA定义），给予特定的药物（控制剂），尽管有很多成员因为一种有争议的方法论而被误判为阳性。由于对更高质量分数的担忧，这个努力继续推进，包括那些误判为阳性的成员，理由是不必要的处方“不会对他们造成伤害”。
- en: These are all relatively simple examples...and the paradox is not a paradox
    at all. It is a choice between self-interest, clouded as the “right thing to do
    for the organization,” and the seemingly obvious ethical course of action. If
    organizations struggle with these choices today, the challenges introduced as
    a result of AI elevate this to a far more complex conversation. As Yuval Noah
    Harari has noted, “Humans are always far better at inventing tools than using
    them wisely.”

  zh: 这些都是相对简单的例子……而悖论根本不是悖论。这是在自私和被模糊成“对组织来说正确的事情”之间的选择，以及看似显而易见的伦理行动。如果组织今天在这些选择上感到困惑，那么由于人工智能引入的挑战将把这提升到一个更加复杂的谈话层面。正如尤瓦尔·赫拉利所指出的，“人类在发明工具方面总是远比明智地使用它们更擅长。”
- en: This should not be written off as the rantings of someone riding on a moral
    high horse. This is basic stuff. Ethical behavior is the cornerstone of a civilized
    society, professionally and personally. Yet ethics today is under attack everywhere,
    with falsehoods presented as “facts” to divert attention and achieve what some
    see as the “greater good.” Having an ethical code of conduct that is carefully
    integrated into an organization’s psyche is a great start to addressing these
    false paradoxes. We can all do better...

  zh: 这不应该被看作是某个站在道德高地上的人的胡言乱语。这是基本的事情。无论是在职业上还是个人生活中，道德行为都是文明社会的基石。然而，当今的伦理观念在各处受到攻击，虚假被塑造成“事实”，以转移注意力并达到某些人眼中的“更大利益”。在组织心灵深处精心融入伦理行为准则是解决这些虚假悖论的一个很好的开端。我们都可以做得更好……
