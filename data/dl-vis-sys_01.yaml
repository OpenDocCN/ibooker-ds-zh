- en: Computer vision is a technological area that’s been advancing rapidly thanks
    to the tremendous advances in artificial intelligence and deep learning that have
    taken place in the past few years. Neural networks now help self-driving cars
    to navigate around other cars, pedestrians, and other obstacles; and recommender
    agents are getting smarter about suggesting products that resemble other products.
    Face-recognition technologies are becoming more sophisticated, too, enabling smartphones
    to recognize faces before unlocking a phone or a door. Computer vision applications
    like these and others have become a staple in our daily lives. However, by moving
    beyond the simple recognition of objects, deep learning has given computers the
    power to imagine and create new things, like art that didn’t exist previously,
    new human faces, and other objects. Part 1 of this book looks at the foundations
    of deep learning, different forms of neural networks, and structured projects
    that go a bit further with concepts like hyperparameter tuning.

  zh: 计算机视觉是一个技术领域，得益于过去几年在人工智能和深度学习方面取得的巨大进步而迅速发展。神经网络现在帮助自动驾驶汽车在周围导航，避开其他车辆、行人和其他障碍物；推荐代理在建议类似其他产品的产品方面变得越来越聪明。面部识别技术也在变得更加复杂，使得智能手机在解锁手机或门之前能够识别面部。像这些以及其他计算机视觉应用已经成为我们日常生活中的必备品。然而，通过超越简单对象的识别，深度学习赋予了计算机想象和创造新事物的能力，如之前不存在过的艺术、新的人类面孔和其他物体。本书的第1部分探讨了深度学习的基础、不同形式的神经网络以及通过超参数调整等概念进一步发展的结构化项目。
