- en: 'A quick question for you: How can you tell a data scientist who’s actually
    built things in production from someone who’s just played with data? Answer: They’ve
    been absolutely burned by data quality. Anybody who’s really deployed data has
    not just one scar, but lashes across their entire body from this problem.'

  zh: 问你一个快速的问题：如何辨别一个真正在生产环境中构建东西的数据科学家和一个只是玩弄数据的人？答案是：他们被数据质量彻底搞崩了。任何真正部署数据的人不仅有一个伤疤，而是从这个问题上遭受了整个身体的鞭打。
- en: Here’s a typical day in the life of a data science team. A senior executive
    sees something weird on a dashboard in the morning, asks if the number is right,
    and then the data team sprints for the next 4 hours to figure out the answer.
    They finally track down the engineer who forgot to add the right tracking mechanism.
    But now it’s past noon and the team hasn’t even gotten to their long list of to-dos
    for the day! Coming out of firefighting mode, it’s hard to make forward progress
    on anything interesting.

  zh: 下面是数据科学团队的典型一天生活。一位高级执行官早上在仪表板上看到一些奇怪的东西，问这个数字是否正确，然后数据团队为了找出答案而奔波了接下来的4个小时。最终他们找到了忘记添加正确追踪机制的工程师。但现在已经过了中午，团队甚至还没开始处理他们当天的长列表待办事项！走出应急模式后，很难在任何有趣的事情上取得进展。
- en: Another way of saying this is that we always let the urgent get in the way of
    the important. More dangerous is that we undermine trust in the data. The data
    science teams end up playing defense rather than offense.

  zh: 另一种说法是，我们总是让紧急事务阻碍了重要事务。更危险的是，我们破坏了对数据的信任。数据科学团队最终陷入防守而非进攻的境地。
- en: I’ve seen this firsthand so many times. At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic,
    I was asked to help the state of California with understanding the potential impact
    of the disease. It was an all-hands-on-deck moment, and we had access to incredible
    resources and data sets. Yet we were still questioning basic numbers on dashboards
    like the number of ICU beds available or how much protective gear was remaining
    at a given hospital. To track down issues in the pipeline, we had to do the equivalent
    of using `printf` statements to debug where the data had gone wrong. Unfortunately,
    we didn’t have a way of running diagnostics to answer very simple questions that
    carried enormous ramifications.

  zh: 我亲眼见过这种情况很多次。在COVID-19大流行初期，我被要求帮助加利福尼亚州了解疾病可能带来的影响。那是一个全员参与的时刻，我们可以访问到令人难以置信的资源和数据集。然而，我们仍然在质疑仪表板上基本数字的准确性，比如ICU床位的可用数量或某个医院剩余多少防护装备。为了追踪问题，我们不得不使用类似于`printf`语句的方式来调试数据何处出了问题。不幸的是，我们没有办法运行诊断来回答那些带有重大后果的非常简单的问题。
- en: Dashboards and decision making are just scratching the surface—what about AI,
    and generative AI in particular? With all the excitement, it sometimes seems like
    we’re forgetting the foundations and how big of an impact data quality has; we
    can’t inspect and debug AI systems like typical software. While the opportunities
    here are great, so are the risks, and operating black-box models without data
    quality control is a scary prospect.

  zh: 仪表板和决策只是皮毛问题——那么人工智能呢，尤其是生成式人工智能呢？尽管存在很多兴奋点，有时似乎我们忽略了基础知识以及数据质量有多么重要；我们不能像典型软件那样检查和调试AI系统。虽然这里的机会巨大，但风险也同样巨大，而在没有数据质量控制的情况下操作黑盒模型是一种可怕的前景。
- en: The fact that data scientists and engineers recognize these problems is an accomplishment
    in and of itself, because it means we have evolved to the next phase of data utilization.
    The first phase was the democratization of data. Now we’re using the data! And
    with the use of data comes great responsibility, and we need the data teams to
    be in better control of their destiny. The analogy is akin to the tools engineers
    have like observability platforms, on-call systems, QA environments, DevOps tooling,
    etc. Data practitioners should have the necessary tooling that lets them get out
    ahead of the root cause of data issues. That’s what this book is about.

  zh: 数据科学家和工程师认识到这些问题本身就是一种成就，因为这意味着我们已经进入了数据利用的下一个阶段。第一阶段是数据的民主化。现在我们正在使用数据！而使用数据也带来了巨大的责任，我们需要数据团队更好地控制自己的命运。这种类比就像工程师拥有的工具，比如可观察性平台、值班系统、QA环境、DevOps工具等。数据从业者应该拥有必要的工具，让他们能够提前解决数据问题的根本原因。这就是这本书要讨论的内容。
- en: To write a really good technical book, you need to have lived it. Jeremy has
    the scars that come from working on data quality not just at one organization,
    but with many teams and stakeholders across different sectors and dimensions.
    In addition, he’s the founder of a company in the space (full disclosure that
    I am also an investor). They understand the issues up and down the stack, including
    all the cultural, political, and technical dynamics. The people who will solve
    data observability are those with unbelievable empathy for the problems, and that’s
    what you will find here.

  zh: 要写一本真正优秀的技术书籍，你需要有亲身经历。Jeremy 拥有从事数据质量工作的伤痕，不仅在一个组织，而是与许多团队和跨不同行业和领域的利益相关者合作。此外，他还是该领域公司的创始人（完全披露，我也是投资者）。他们深入了解堆栈上下的所有问题，包括所有文化、政治和技术动态。解决数据可观察性问题的人是那些对问题有着不可思议的同情心的人，这正是你在这里找到的。
- en: 'My advice to readers: Don’t feel like you have to read this book straight through
    on the first go. Instead, skim through it and get the lay of the land. It’s just
    like a dataset. You play with it, see what’s there and what interests you, and
    then go deeper over time. You can apply this book in pieces, digest it, and refer
    to it whenever you’re facing a specific problem. I have no doubt you’ll want to
    come back to these pages again and again.'

  zh: 我对读者的建议：不要觉得第一遍就要一口气把这本书读完。相反，快速浏览一下，了解大致内容。就像处理数据集一样。你可以玩弄它，看看有什么内容和你感兴趣的地方，然后随着时间的推移深入了解。你可以分段应用这本书，消化它，并在面对特定问题时参考它。毫无疑问，你会想一次又一次地回到这些页面。
