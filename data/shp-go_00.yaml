- en: I’ve been thinking for a very long time about writing this book. At the beginning
    of my software engineering career, I could not have cared less about processes
    and procedures for getting things done. It all seemed so boring. But given some
    inspiration from my managers, I started diving into API development, Agile processes,
    unit testing, continuous delivery, and integration, and I soon found myself drowning
    in resources, guides, and conference talks.

  zh: 我已经很久在考虑写这本书了。在我软件工程职业生涯的开始，我对完成工作的流程和程序根本不感兴趣。这一切似乎都太无聊了。但在我的管理者们的启发下，我开始深入研究API开发、敏捷流程、单元测试、持续交付和集成，很快我就发现自己淹没在资源、指南和会议演讲中。
- en: It wasn’t until I read *The Phoenix Project* by Gene Kim, George Spafford, and
    Kevin Behr that it all clicked. Here was a story about a company struggling to
    develop and ship quality software products. Where was this book when I started
    out?! I paired *The Phoenix Project* with *The Pragmatic Programmer,* by Andy
    Hunt and Dave Thomas, and felt like I had gained a brand-new perspective on my
    career.

  zh: 直到阅读了Gene Kim、George Spafford和Kevin Behr合著的《凤凰项目》，我才恍然大悟。这是一个关于一家公司努力开发和交付高质量软件产品的故事。当我刚开始的时候，这本书在哪里？！我将《凤凰项目》与Andy
    Hunt和Dave Thomas合著的《实用程序员》结合起来，感觉自己对我的职业生涯有了全新的认识。
- en: Like all young idealists, I annoyed my colleagues with my newfound knowledge
    and sense of superiority, only to be brought back to earth by others who showed
    me where we had already implemented some of the concepts I learned. I interviewed
    coworkers and those who’d worked in the industry for many years and then used
    this information, along with books by Martin Fowler and Kent Beck, to help me
    understand areas where my company could improve.

  zh: 就像所有年轻的理想主义者一样，我用我新获得的知识和优越感让我的同事感到烦恼，直到其他人向我展示了我们已经在哪些地方实施了我在学习中了解到的一些概念。我采访了同事以及那些在行业内工作多年的人士，然后利用这些信息，结合Martin
    Fowler和Kent Beck的书籍，帮助我理解公司可以改进的领域。
- en: Soon, I sent write-ups and documents to my bosses and made suggestions during
    meetings--but there were too many ideas and too little time. Frustrated at my
    lack of progress internally and with a mountain of research material and sample
    code piling up, I decided to move onward in my career journey.

  zh: 很快，我将总结和文档发送给我的上司，并在会议中提出建议——但想法太多，时间太少。对于我在内部缺乏进展以及堆积如山的研究材料和示例代码感到沮丧，我决定在职业生涯的道路上继续前进。
- en: It took me landing three additional positions to put many of these ideas into
    practice and experiment with others. As you’ll find out in this book, we developers
    need to not only deliver on ideas but also reflect on how we can make them better.
    I found this theme of the continuous feedback loop throughout all the books I
    read about writing, testing, and deploying software but never all in one book
    with examples. When Manning approached me to write this book, it was originally
    about a completely different topic, and then, over the course of various forms
    of feedback by editors, reviewers, early purchasers, and industry professionals,
    we arrived at the book you are now reading. The embodiment of the process described
    in this book went into making the book (deployments and CI were even used). Even
    the title was changed several times to nail down the one that best describes what
    the book is about!
  id: totrans-6
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 我需要获得三个额外的职位，才能将许多这些想法付诸实践，并尝试其他想法。正如你将在本书中了解到的那样，我们开发者不仅需要实现想法，还需要反思如何使它们变得更好。我在阅读关于编写、测试和部署软件的所有书籍中，都发现了这个持续反馈循环的主题，但从未在一本书中用实例全部展示出来。当Manning出版社邀请我写这本书时，最初的主题完全不同，然后，在编辑、审稿人、早期购买者和行业专业人士的各种形式的反馈过程中，我们最终得到了你现在正在阅读的这本书。本书中描述的过程体现在了制作这本书的过程中（甚至使用了部署和持续集成）。甚至连书名都修改了好几次，以确保找到最能描述本书主题的那个！
- en: You’ll find that I’ve structured the book in a way that mirrors the complexity
    that arises with growth. Startups and preliminary projects need to be fast and
    light to find their market, whereas in the later stages, they need to consider
    code, architecture, and testing more broadly and at scale, so I focus on describing
    easy and inexpensive solutions at the beginning and introduce more advanced and
    complex solutions at the end. I also hope you see that the material I present
    here is modular. Languages, platforms, and deployment patterns don’t matter. What
    does matter is building a process. To emphasize this, I use many languages and
    deployment patterns throughout the book.

  zh: 你会发现，我按照随着增长而产生的复杂性来结构化这本书。初创公司和初步项目需要快速且轻量级以找到他们的市场，而在后期阶段，他们需要更广泛和大规模地考虑代码、架构和测试，因此我在一开始就专注于描述简单且经济的解决方案，并在最后介绍更高级和复杂的解决方案。我也希望你能看到，我这里呈现的材料是模块化的。语言、平台和部署模式并不重要。重要的是建立一个流程。为了强调这一点，我在整本书中使用了多种语言和部署模式。
- en: I chose Go as the primary language because it is what I write code in daily.
    But I’ve worked in many languages, and many concepts described in this book are
    language agnostic, so we’ve selected a few other popular languages as examples
    in the appendices. Additionally, at the end of the book, I discuss a split in
    patterns in the industry, using infrastructure as code, as compared to container-based
    deployment strategies.

  zh: 我选择Go作为主要语言，因为它是我日常编写代码的语言。但我使用过许多语言，这本书中描述的许多概念都是语言无关的，所以我们还在附录中选择了其他一些流行的语言作为示例。此外，在书的结尾，我讨论了行业中的模式分裂，即使用基础设施即代码与基于容器的部署策略相比。
- en: In the spirit of *The Phoenix Projec*t (and its inspiration, *The Goal*, by
    Eliyahu Goldratt), this book is told in a semi-narrative format. My hope here
    is to have you, the reader, draw on your own experiences and struggles so that
    you can compare it to the ones I’m writing about. Did you encounter the same problem?
