  zh: 引言
- en: I migrated from mathematics into the field of genomics in 1985—roughly a year
    before the field officially came into existence. The word *genomics* was coined
    in 1986, which also saw the first public debate, at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory,
    about the notion of mounting a Human Genome Project.

  zh: 我于1985年从数学领域转入基因组学领域——比该领域正式诞生早了大约一年。术语*基因组学*于1986年首次被提出，同时也见证了在冷泉港实验室举行的首场关于启动人类基因组计划概念的公开辩论。
- en: It’s hard to imagine how much has changed since then. Computers hardly figured
    in biomedicine—the initial design for the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research,
    founded in the early 1980s, included no provision for a computer. Large amounts
    of data were seen as a nuisance, not an asset—in a Nature article reporting on
    the Human Genome Project debate, the journal’s biology editor wrote, “If the skill
    and ingenuity of modern biology are already stretched to interpret sequences of
    known importance, such as those of the DMD and CGD genes, what possible use could
    be made of more sequences?”

  zh: 很难想象自那时以来发生了多大的变化。计算机几乎没有出现在生物医学中——白头研究所生物医学研究的初步设计，建立于上世纪80年代初，没有考虑到计算机的安排。大量数据被视为一种麻烦，而非资产——在一篇报道人类基因组计划辩论的《自然》杂志文章中，该杂志的生物学编辑写道：“如果现代生物学的技能和创造力已经被拉伸到解释已知重要性序列（例如DMD和CGD基因序列）的程度，那么更多序列能有什么可能用途？”
- en: Despite such doubts, biologists eventually decided to press on—launching the
    Human Genome Project, their first major data gathering effort, in 1990\. One of
    the important motivations was the prospect of deploying systematic methods—rather
    than guesswork—to discover the genes responsible for human diseases. In 1980,
    a brilliant biologist, David Botstein, had conceived how to find the location
    of genes for rare monogenic diseases by tracing their inheritance in families
    relative to a genetic map of DNA variants across the human genome. Realizing the
    full power of the idea, though, would require mapping—and eventually sequencing—the
    entire human genome.

  zh: 尽管有诸多疑虑，生物学家们最终决定继续前进——1990年启动了人类基因组计划，这是他们的首个重大数据收集努力之一。其中一个重要动机是希望采用系统方法——而非猜测——来发现导致人类疾病的基因。1980年，杰出的生物学家大卫·博茨坦提出了一种方法，通过追踪基因在家族中的遗传来定位罕见单基因疾病的位置，相对于人类基因组中的DNA变异遗传图谱。然而，要实现这一想法的全部力量，需要绘制——并最终测序——整个人类基因组。
- en: The Human Genome Project was an extraordinary collaboration that spanned six
    countries and twenty institutions, took thirteen years, and cost $3 billion. When
    the dust settled, the world had the three billion nucleotide-long DNA sequence
    of a single human genome.

  zh: 人类基因组计划是一个非同寻常的合作项目，涵盖了六个国家和二十个机构，历时十三年，耗资30亿美元。当风尘落定时，世界上获得了一个单个人类基因组长达30亿核苷酸的DNA序列。
- en: 'With this project completed, many biologists thought that business would return
    to usual. But what happened next was even more remarkable. Over the next 15 years,
    biology became an information science—in which the generation of massive amounts
    of data reshaped the field. For example:'

    $3 billion to $600—and the cost is likely to reach $100 in the coming years. More
    than one million genomes have been sequenced so far. Overall, genomic data of
    all kinds is doubling roughly every eight months.

  zh: 令人惊讶的是，测序一个人类基因组的成本降低了五百万倍——从30亿美元降至600美元——而且成本预计在未来几年可能会降至100美元以下。到目前为止，已经测序了一百多万个基因组。总体而言，各种类型的基因组数据大约每八个月翻一番。
- en: None of this would have been possible without the development of powerful new
    computational methods and tools to work with the many new types of data that were
    being generated. A good example is the Genome Analysis Toolkit, developed by colleagues
    at the Broad Institute, which you’ll read a lot more about in this book.

- en: Today, life sciences are in the midst of new data explosions. Many countries
    are undertaking systematic efforts to collect genomic and medical data into national
    biobanks, which will give researchers the ability to probe even further into the
    genetics of both common and rare diseases and traits. It will be especially important
    to ensure that the world’s full genetic diversity is represented in these large-scale
    efforts—not just people of European descent.

- en: Because of the amazing technological progress in recent years, we can now read
    out not just the DNA blueprint, but how this blueprint is read out as RNA in individual
    cells. Methods have been developed to read out gene expression at the single-cell
    level, with an initial analysis of 18 cells soon leading to analyses of more than
    18 million cells. This work has given rise to an international Human Cell Atlas
    project, involving more than 60 countries around the world. These datasets are
    beginning to make it possible to use computational methods, including modern machine
    learning, to systematically infer the underlying circuitry of cells.

- en: 'As the biological applications burgeon, though, we are often held back by systemic
    limitations in how we access and share data. Most of the world’s biomedical data
    has traditionally been held in silos—accessible only through servers from which
    each authorized researcher or group must download their own copies to their own
    institution’s computing infrastructure. From a purely technical standpoint, this
    is unsustainable. Instead of bringing data to researchers, we need systems that
    allow researchers to operate on the data where it resides. We also need more transparent
    models for managing custody of the data, as well as efficient ways to assess,
    enforce and audit who can access the data and for what purpose. We should aim
    to abide by these four principles: (1) copying data should not be the default
    mode of sharing data; (2) security and auditing should be baked in and enterprise-grade;
    (3) large-scale analysis should be accessible to all research groups; and (4)
    computational resources should be elastic, so that they can be scaled up or down
    as needed.'

  zh: 然而，随着生物应用的蓬勃发展，我们常常受制于我们访问和共享数据的系统性限制。世界上大多数生物医学数据传统上都存储在孤立的数据岛上，只能通过服务器访问，每个授权的研究人员或团体必须将其下载到自己机构的计算基础设施中。从纯技术角度来看，这是不可持续的。我们需要的是能够让研究人员在数据所在地操作数据的系统。我们还需要更透明的数据管理模型，以及有效的评估、执行和审计能够访问数据以及用途的方式。我们应该遵循以下四个原则：(1)
    复制数据不应该是数据共享的默认模式；(2) 安全和审计应该内置并达到企业级；(3) 大规模分析应该对所有研究团体可访问；以及 (4) 计算资源应该是弹性的，可以根据需要扩展或缩减。

- en: 'At the Broad Institute, we started moving to the cloud four years ago, to cope
    with the rising tide of genomic data. We cut our teeth by converting our genomic
    data-processing operation from a traditional on-premises system to one that runs
    on the cloud from the moment the data is generated in our genome sequence platform.
    That move required rethinking every aspect of the process and building entirely
    new systems from scratch to handle the terabytes of data that come streaming off
    sequencing machines every day. But that was just the beginning. Once the data
    was up on the cloud, we hit the next obstacle: the available cloud services, in
    their current state, can be daunting to use for life sciences researchers without
    advanced training. So, we teamed up with partners to develop a software and analysis
    platform, Terra.'

  zh: 在 Broad Institute，我们四年前开始向云端迁移，以应对不断增长的基因组数据潮流。我们首先通过将基因组数据处理操作从传统的本地系统转换为云端系统来积累经验，从基因序列平台生成数据的那一刻起就在云端运行。这一举措要求重新考虑整个流程的每一个方面，并从零开始构建全新的系统，以处理每天从测序机器中流出的几TB数据。但这只是个开始。一旦数据上传到云端，我们遇到了下一个障碍：当前状态下，云服务对于生命科学研究人员而言可能难以使用，除非他们接受过高级培训。因此，我们与合作伙伴合作开发了一个软件和分析平台
    Terra。

    steam in biomedical research. Today we are working with many other groups to build
    a federated data ecosystem of interconnected components that offer complementary
    services and capabilities. We expect these platforms will help facilitate the
    kind of open collaboration that is needed to bring together data, tools, and expertise
    spanning multiple domains and disciplines. We also want to lower the technical
    thresholds for individual researchers to participate in the cloud-based ecosystem,
    especially those with fewer IT resources at their disposal.
