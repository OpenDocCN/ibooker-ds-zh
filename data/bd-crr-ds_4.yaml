- en: Well, we’ve sure covered a lot. We started with defining data science and what
    skills you need to do it, walked through how to prepare for and get a data science
    job, and then discussed how to grow and flourish in the field. Over 16 chapters,
    we went from understanding different types of companies to making unit testing
    for production models to becoming a manager.

  zh: 好吧，我们确实涵盖了很多内容。我们从定义数据科学以及你需要哪些技能来做它开始，然后介绍了如何准备和获得数据科学工作，接着讨论了如何在领域内成长和繁荣。在16个章节中，我们从理解不同类型的公司到为生产模型编写单元测试，再到成为一名管理者。
- en: 'When you look at the book holistically, a few trends seem to flow through it.
    These lessons apply to all points of a data scientist’s journey in different forms.
    For us, these three ideals have kept our careers continuously moving forward:'

  zh: 当你从整体上看待这本书时，似乎有几个趋势贯穿其中。这些经验教训以不同形式适用于数据科学家旅程的各个阶段。对我们来说，这三个理想一直推动着我们的职业生涯不断前进：
- en: '***A data scientist needs to be able to communicate.*** Over and over, people
    we interviewed for the book mentioned that their success came from communicating
    their work effectively. Whether effective communication is making a report for
    an executive, collaborating with an engineering team on a model, or being able
    to speak in a way that non-data scientists understand, it can help you through
    the process of finding a job and working with other people in that job.'

  zh: '***数据科学家需要能够沟通。*** 我们在为这本书采访的人反复提到，他们的成功来自于有效地传达他们的工作。无论是为高管制作报告、与工程团队合作模型，还是以非数据科学家能够理解的方式说话，这都可以帮助你找到工作并与其他人一起工作。'
- en: '***A data scientist needs to be proactive.*** It’s exceedingly rare for a data
    scientist to be handed a perfectly well-formed problem and the tools to solve
    the problem. Instead, data scientists need to proactively try to find data, create
    new ideas for models, and try experiments. Being proactive and doing things like
    making a portfolio will also help you get a job. The more you can take initiative
    and find solutions to problems, the better.'

  zh: '***数据科学家需要积极主动。*** 数据科学家很少会得到一个完美形成的问题和解决问题的工具。相反，数据科学家需要主动寻找数据，为模型创造新想法，并尝试实验。积极主动地做事，比如制作个人作品集，也会帮助你找到工作。你越能主动解决问题，效果就越好。'
- en: '***A data scientist needs community.*** No one makes it in any career without
    help from others, but as members of a new and fast-growing field, data scientists
    especially benefit from developing strong professional relationships. These relationships
    can take many forms. A sponsor can recommend you as a speaker for a meetup that
    leads, two years later, to keynoting an international conference. A mentor can
    give you feedback on your résumé and refer you to a position at their company.
    A manager can help bridge the gap with stakeholders and suggest areas for personal
    growth. Or a peer can simply commiserate with you and lift your spirits after
    a tough day at work. It’s worth spending time building these relationships to
    tackle the many challenges you’ll face in your career.'

  zh: '***数据科学家需要社区。*** 没有人在没有他人帮助的情况下在任何职业中取得成功，但作为新兴且快速发展的领域成员，数据科学家特别受益于建立强大的专业关系。这些关系可以采取多种形式。赞助人可以推荐你作为会议的演讲者，两年后，这可能导致在国际会议上发表主题演讲。导师可以对你的简历提供反馈，并将你推荐到他们公司的一个职位。经理可以帮助与利益相关者建立联系，并提出个人成长领域。或者，同事可以在你工作艰难的一天后简单地安慰你，提振你的精神。花时间建立这些关系来应对你职业生涯中面临的许多挑战是值得的。'
- en: We hope that you’ve enjoyed reading the book; we certainly enjoyed writing it.
    In creating the book, we found that many of our own experiences poured into it.
    At multiple times during the writing process, we even reread it ourselves to better
    think through our own career decisions. We wish you the best of luck in your data
    science career journey!
