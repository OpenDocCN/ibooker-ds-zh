- en: Entities such as people, communities, corporations, and so on each have an identity.
    They have realities, characteristics, and special traits that uniquely qualify
    them and distinguish them from one another. Such identity defines who they are
    in the universe of beings. Until recently, before the Big Data revolution that
    is still unfolding, entities were identified with just a few data points.

  zh: 诸如人、社区、公司等实体都有各自的身份。它们拥有现实、特征和独特的特质，这些独特的特质使它们与其他实体区分开来。这种身份定义了它们在存在宇宙中的本质。直到不久之前，即使是在仍在展开的大数据革命之前，实体们也只能用几个数据点来识别。
- en: 'For people, it was mainly their first and family names, their place of origin,
    and maybe their parents’ names and tribe. Leonardo da Vinci, who was born in Anchiano
    near Vinci in Italy, was well known across history and geographies with respect
    to his place of origin. Companies may have simply assumed the name of their founder.
    The means of information dissemination were limited; so, too, was what needed
    to be known about people, communities, or companies. When we were asked a simple
    question about who we were, our answer was always limited to a few data points
    that best described us: our name, place of origin, profession and place of work,
    and so forth.'

  zh: 对于人们来说，主要是他们的名字和姓氏，他们的出生地，也可能是他们父母的名字和部落。列奥纳多·达·芬奇出生在意大利的文奇附近的安基亚诺，他在历史和地理上因其出生地而闻名。公司可能只是简单地沿用其创始人的名字。信息传播手段有限，因此对人、社区或公司所需了解的也有所限制。当被问及我们是谁时，我们的答案总是局限于几个最能描述我们的数据点：我们的名字、出生地、职业和工作地点等。
- en: The 21st century, however, has seen an explosion of information about everyone
    and everything, amplified by social media. Data has assumed prime importance.
    It is collected about everyone and everything. More is known about any of us than
    we can imagine. More and more qualifiers can describe the identity of anyone.
    Therefore, our freedom is in question. Lives can be instantly destroyed when information
    is weaponized against them. People’s habits are being mapped, and the data collected
    about them is being used in many ways. Companies that can better capture their
    customers’ buying behaviors can drive them to spend more by anticipating their
    needs and inviting them to every kind of offering.

  zh: 然而，21世纪见证了信息爆炸，社交媒体的作用进一步放大。数据变得至关重要。它被收集于每个人和每件事。我们对任何人的了解超出了我们的想象。越来越多的定性因素可以描述任何人的身份。因此，我们的自由受到质疑。当信息被武器化对付他们时，生活可能会瞬间被摧毁。人们的习惯被绘制出来，并且收集到的数据以多种方式被利用。能够更好地捕捉客户购买行为的公司可以通过预测他们的需求并邀请他们参与各种服务来促使他们消费更多。
- en: Just like any good technology designed to improve people’s lives, information
    in the wrong hands can become poisonous. Instead of helping people receive the
    right care for a disease, get to the right place at the right time, or minimize
    their expenditure of time and money, information can essentially empty them of
    their human content and dignity. It can reveal where they are, what they own,
    and so on. Therefore, data privacy assumes a vital importance. Unauthorized disclosure
    of people’s concealed information with intrusion in their private life should
    be prevented.

  zh: 就像任何旨在改善人们生活的良好技术一样，信息落入错误的手中可能变得有害。信息不仅未能帮助人们得到正确的疾病治疗、准时到达适当的地点或者减少他们的时间和金钱支出，反而可能剥夺他们的人性内容和尊严。它可以揭示他们的位置、拥有的东西等。因此，数据隐私显得至关重要。必须防止未经授权的披露人们隐秘信息并侵入其私生活。
- en: Now the question is how to determine what data can be ethically utilized. The
    key word in this question is “ethically.” Ethics, in simple terms, is a set of
    moral principles or values by which particular groups of people live their lives.
    The rules of the system are defined to guide the conduct of individuals and protect
    their lives and their community’s life. It is therefore crucial that the communities
    that live by the same ethical rules define themselves, or become involved in defining
    what constitutes their privacy, to be protected from unauthorized publication.
    Since such a set of rules can vary between tribes, communities, and nations, the
    individuals of those groups are best suited to draw the line between public and
    private, and everyone else that deals with them should respect such demarcation.

  zh: 现在的问题是如何确定哪些数据可以在道德上被利用。这个问题中的关键词是“道德”。伦理学简单来说是一组道德原则或价值观，用来指导特定群体的生活方式。系统的规则被定义来指导个人的行为，并保护他们的生命和社区的生命。因此，那些遵循相同伦理规则的社区自己定义或参与定义其隐私的内容是至关重要的，以免受到未经授权的发布的侵害。由于这样一套规则可以在部落、社区和国家之间有所不同，这些群体的个体最适合划定公共和私人之间的界限，其他与他们打交道的人也应该尊重这种划分。
- en: When the plethora of data described earlier is not passed through the lenses
    of a set of rules, every individual’s natural life can easily be compromised.
    This will prevent people from living freely and realizing their potential. The
    European Union has promulgated the legislation known as GDPR to protect the data
    and privacy of its citizens as well as control the transfer of their personal
    information outside of the EU.
