    for those companies that can iterate quickly and find customer value before their
    competitors. Some of the recent trends that allow large organizations to move
    fast include the adoption of cloud platforms and microservice architectures. While
    some of the trends have evolved, one thing has remained constant: when things
    go wrong, we need to quickly understand where to look to fix the problem. Microservices
    and ephemeral cloud infrastructure (containers, etc.) exacerbate this problem.'

- en: I vividly remember working on a particularly nasty distributed problem for a
    client a few years back wherein a set of services would communicate with each
    other to provide some business function, and after six days (almost on the dot!),
    the set of services would all come crashing down. The resulting outage caused
    significant revenue loss for this client. The client decided to restart all of
    the services one by one after four days to avoid the problem.

- en: 'After observing the system for a few days, I noticed that the memory usage
    of all of the services involved in the call graph was growing significantly, so
    I worked with the client to safely capture memory and thread dumps to understand
    what was happening. I determined that a particular buffer was getting filled,
    but when looking through the code it was very difficult to identify why this was
    happening. The system included both blocking and nonblocking code on various threads,
    which made it difficult to work with. I had to turn to a tried-and-true foundation
    of working with distributed systems to help diagnose the issue: logging events.'

- en: After a few days spent diligently poring over many hundreds of thousands of
    log lines across the various services, I was able to see that a certain combination
    of messages that flowed through the system triggered a memory leak in all of the

    services.

- en: Although logging helped significantly in this endeavor, it was not easy. The
    logging was not consistent across the services, the timestamps were wrong, and
    the technology used to pull the logs from the machines would sometimes fail, crash,
    or corrupt the log files. We also lost valuable log data as the services were
    restarted after four days because the client could not take an outage. If the
    client had a better logging and observability architecture, a lot of this would
    have been simplified and would have reduced the time to pinpoint the OOM issue.

    good logging patterns and demonstrates this with concrete technology and examples
    using a ubiquitous log collection and aggregation technology called Fluentd. Fluentd
    is used to collect, unify, and stream logging data from a variety of systems to
    a centralized data store, which can then be used for proper analysis. Phil walks
    the reader through building a logging system, taking into account such things

    Azure environments. I then jumped to Treasure Data, where I managed the project,

- en: In some ways, this book has been in development for as long as I have worked
    in the software industry. This may sound odd, given that my career in IT started
    in the early ’90s. I learned early on the importance of logging and translating
    error events into diagnoses and problem resolution. Lessons came from being a
    young lead developer on a critical product development running round-the-clock
    system testing. If something wasn’t shown on the displays, it was assumed to be
    a presentation system problem, so get Phil—he needs to fix things now, even if
    it is some antisocial time of day or night. The reality was that the presentation
    subsystem was rarely at fault. The error originating from one of many complex
    backend systems sent erroneous data or tried to communicate using the wrong version
    of the interface. The better I made the logging to help show what had or had not
    been sent to the display system, the fewer the calls received.

  zh: 在某些方面，这本书的开发时间几乎和我从事软件行业的时间一样长。考虑到我的IT生涯始于20世纪90年代初，这听起来可能有些奇怪。我早期就意识到了记录和将错误事件转化为诊断和问题解决的重要性。这些经验来自于担任一个关键产品开发项目的年轻主导开发者，进行全天候的系统测试。如果显示器上没有显示问题，就会认为是演示系统的问题，所以找Phil——他现在需要解决问题，哪怕是在一些不合适的时间或夜晚。现实情况是，演示子系统很少出问题。错误通常源于众多复杂的后端系统之一，它们发送错误数据或尝试使用错误的接口版本进行通信。我越改进日志记录以帮助显示是否已将数据发送到显示系统，收到的电话就越少。
- en: Over the years, I’ve seen the constant drive to deliver functionality and features
    over giving the nonfunctional aspects the attention sometimes needed. Functional
    goals will always override the nonfunctional considerations. As software developers,
    we can be our own worst enemies when it comes to monitoring and logging. Writing
    logging events isn’t that exciting when our code runs sweetly and passes all our
    unit tests. The functionality is complete and within the agreed time as far as
    the decision-makers are concerned, so why spend more time on the solution?

- en: The reality is that we often collect logs and stick them in a dark place until
    something starts to go wrong. Logging will never be a sexy subject, but it is
    essential, and when done well, it can allow us to do some clever stuff. Good logging
    makes it possible for machine learning and artificial intelligence to be used
    for pattern recognition or to directly notify the right person to address the
    issue. You could go as far as detecting a log event and then trigger housekeeping
    processes to avoid a problem. IBM used to call the ideas of self-protecting and
    self-healing processes *autonomics*—sound more fun now?

- en: My open source background started about the same time as I switched to using
    Java (release 1.4 had just come out), starting with libraries such as Log4J. This
    progressed to larger open source solutions like JBoss v3 application server, and
    then working with Fuse (Apache CXF, Camel, ServiceMix, and ActiveMQ) before RedHat
    acquired the businesses, building and providing services for these frameworks.
    One of the great things about truly open-source solutions are the vendor-agnostic
    characteristics, which means it can have adaptors and plugins covering a diverse
    set of sources, making it easy to integrate. An architecture that lends itself
    well to integrating things will encourage such an ecosystem to thrive, and that’s
    what Fluentd has.

    want to be indispensable, as it means you’re back to being called upon day and
    night. Better to share your knowledge with all. Make your investment in developing
    knowledge worthwhile; people are far more likely to appreciate it and come back

    opportunities to move log management to exciting places and address many significant
    log management challenges in a hybrid and multicloud space. However, I felt it
    was underrepresented in terms of explaining and illustrating Fluentd’s capability
    and potential in a cohesive way, and thus this book was born. This might suggest
    that the Fluentd documentation is terrible, but far from it. The online documentation

    crossing data centers and hosting vendors). Given this, much of the book focuses

    to keep an archaic piece of undocumented software that no one dares touch running
    through the day. For the architect who is thinking about reducing the run costs
    for a system to release future funding on the next cool enhancement. For the developer
    writing code who doesn’t want to be called at 3:00 a.m. to sort out a problem
    because logs aren’t clear about what is going wrong and causing code to fail.

    put the log events into storage, such as structured files or repositories like
    a NoSQL database. We then look at approaches that support post-event analysis

    log events in different languages. The chapter examines how log events can be
    sent to Fluentd using techniques that are more direct than log files. Avoiding
    this step gains efficiency and flexibility in our setup. We take a tour of how
    many logging frameworks are organized and connect such frameworks directly to
    Fluentd rather than stepping via log files, including how this can be done without
