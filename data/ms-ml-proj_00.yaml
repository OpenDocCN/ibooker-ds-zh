- en: I can’t pin down a moment or weave a convincing anecdote that explains how I
    came to realize that writing a book about how to manage a machine-learning project
    would be a good thing to do. The gist of it is that sometime in 2019 I realized
    that I was talking to a lot of people who had started an ML project and were in
    trouble with it, and usually I knew why.

  zh: 我无法确定一个时刻或编织一个令人信服的故事来解释我是如何意识到写一本关于如何管理机器学习项目的书是一件好事的。其核心在于，在2019年某个时候，我意识到我在与很多开始机器学习项目并陷入困境的人交谈，而且通常我知道原因。
- en: There wasn’t one common malady or even a single theme, rather failures seemed
    to come from lots of different directions. Disparate as the failings of these
    projects were, there was a common cause at work here. The folks leading these
    projects were talented, clever, articulate, and skilled, but they were inexperienced.

  zh: 没有一种常见的疾病或甚至一个单一的主题，而是失败似乎来自很多不同的方向。尽管这些项目的失败各不相同，但这里有一个共同的原因。领导这些项目的人有才能、聪明、善于表达和有技能，但他们缺乏经验。
- en: I was very lucky in the timing of my career. I got into ML when it was on the
    edge of applications. In the late 1990’s, ML was out there in the wild, and we
    could do real things with our three-layer perceptron’s and decision trees. It
    was much harder to deliver, algorithms needed to be coded by hand, data was vanishing
    rare, and everything ran sooooo slowly. Most of all, ML skills were as rare as
    the projects that needed them and applied ML was seen as R&D. For me this meant
    that I had the opportunity to develop and work on project after project. Most
    of them failed—but the ones that did come off really, really, really came off.

  zh: 我在职业生涯的时间安排上非常幸运。我进入机器学习领域时，它正处于应用的边缘。在20世纪90年代末，机器学习在野外，我们可以用我们的三层感知器和决策树做些真正的事情。交付起来要困难得多，算法需要手动编码，数据非常罕见，而且一切运行得非常慢。最重要的是，机器学习技能像需要它们的那些项目一样罕见，应用机器学习被视为研发。对我来说，这意味着我有机会发展和从事一个接一个的项目。大多数都失败了——但那些成功实施的项目真的非常成功。
- en: The rare wins kept me in work and kept my career going. In turn, this paid the
    mortgage and filled the freezer. With hindsight, I can say now that it was the
    failures that were the most valuable. I had the luxury of failure and learning,
    which isn’t often afforded to people today. I also got the opportunity to join
    communities of people going through the same thing, and we would all get really
    drunk and tell each other sad (and funny) stories of catastrophe. A bunch of practices
    and behaviors became common knowledge in the clique of AI researchers working
    in big western companies in those days. I sat on the fringes and had the luck
    of being able to pick this all up and then use it.

- en: Having had the luck of getting enough experience to steer an ML project or ten
    to success, it would be dumb not to share it. ML and AI are technologies that
    can be used for good, hopefully helping to confront climate change, pandemics,

    I can help someone else do a couple of projects that make the world a better place!

    real world. First, Andy Rossiter, who was my boss at the time, told me that my
    team needed to have a methodology to tell customers how we would tackle their
    problems. I realized that I couldn’t really point at one, so I’d have to write
    one. That probably wouldn’t have gone all that far if it wasn’t for the second
