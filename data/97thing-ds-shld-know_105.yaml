- en: I stood in the amphitheater-shaped room presenting results from the latest machine
    learning model we had implemented. It would optimize prices at an online retailer
    that was embracing the novelty of data science in order to drive revenue. I looked
    up to face my accuser.

  zh: 我站在像露天剧场一样的房间里，展示我们最新实施的机器学习模型的结果。这个模型将优化在线零售商的价格，这家零售商正在积极采纳数据科学的新颖性以推动收入增长。我抬头面对我的指责者。
- en: We’d had modest success to that point and were proposing a new metric to measure
    the impact moving forward. We avoided most of the usual political turmoil that
    exists in bigger companies by maintaining a relatively flat organization, both
    in hierarchy and in operation. Folks with good ideas that delivered results were
    consistently given room to make decisions and own strategic direction.

  zh: 到目前为止，我们取得了一些小小的成功，并提议采用一种新的指标来衡量未来的影响。通过保持一个相对扁平的组织结构，无论是在层级还是操作上，我们避开了大公司中常见的政治动荡。那些提出有成效想法的人一直都被给予空间去做决策和拥有战略方向。
- en: 'One drawback to this structure is the ability of folks with different agendas
    to derail progress that others make. Such was the case on this day, as a leader
    of a marketing team (which had been tasked with driving up demand and was struggling
    to do so) expressed doubt in the metric we were proposing. They accused my team
    and me of “misleading” the organization by showing the results in the way we were.
    Most of the folks in the room were not quantitatively minded and didn’t see the
    attack for what it was: a political maneuver designed to position one group higher
    at the expense of another.'

  zh: 这种结构的一个缺点是具有不同议程的人可能会阻碍他人取得的进展。这一天就是这样的情况，一个市场团队的领导（他们被委托推动需求增长，但进展并不顺利）对我们提议的指标表示怀疑。他们指责我和我的团队以我们目前的方式展示结果是在“误导”组织。会议室里的大多数人对量化并不感兴趣，并没有意识到这是一场政治策略，旨在通过牺牲他人来提升一个团队的地位。
- en: As a reader, you may react by questioning the details (they are many, and the
    history is long) and supposing that perhaps intentions were misinterpreted (they
    may have been). We can debate the accuracy or intent of each of the players involved,
    but the point is that these are the players (real humans) in the corporate battles
    we see across all companies today, in which customers, their data, and their actions
    and behaviors are used as weapons to get competitive edges over corporate colleagues,
    internal or external.

  zh: 作为读者，您可能会对细节产生质疑（它们很多，历史也很长），并且可能会认为意图被误解了（可能确实如此）。我们可以辩论每个参与者的准确性或意图，但关键是这些都是参与当前所有公司内部战斗的实际人员，客户及其数据和行为被用作武器以获取与公司同事（内部或外部）的竞争优势。
- en: We have seen the start of government regulation with enactment of the EU’s GDPR
    and similar measures worldwide, but what about within the corporate walls? When
    pressed for results (increased revenue, decreased cost, or some other insight
    to drive business strategy) and faced with severe penalties if results aren’t
    delivered (annual bonus impact, salary, promotion eligibility, etc.), what levers
    will people reach for?

  zh: 我们已经看到了政府监管的开端，比如欧盟的GDPR及全球类似措施，但在公司内部呢？当需要成果（增加收入、降低成本或其他洞察驱动业务策略）并面临严厉处罚（年度奖金影响、工资、晋升资格等）时，人们会采取哪些手段呢？
- en: We are now in an environment in which actions and strategies are visible only
    underneath the algorithms/models/artificial intelligences that the designers/architects
    may or may not understand. There has been talk recently about how Google had swayed
    some nonzero number of voters, talk that has even [reached the Senate floor for
    a hearing](https://oreil.ly/s0Sov). Does this result potentially come from an
    executive leader demanding results and corporate citizens delivering click-through
    rates, page views, and/or insights that come from manipulating customers’ search
    results? If so, who is making the decision about when the line is crossed between
    legally campaigning and election meddling? Is it the employees who are driven
    to deliver results at the risk of losing a promotion/bonus/job?

  zh: 我们现在处于一个环境中，其中的行动和策略只在设计师/架构师可能或可能不理解的算法/模型/人工智能之下才能看到。最近有关于谷歌如何影响了一些非零选民的讨论，甚至已经[到了参议院听证会的地步](https://oreil.ly/s0Sov)。这一结果是否可能来自于高层领导要求结果，企业公民交付点击率、页面浏览量和/或通过操纵客户搜索结果获得的见解？如果是这样，谁在决定合法竞选和选举干预之间的界限究竟是什么？是那些为了不失去晋升/奖金/工作而努力交付结果的员工吗？
