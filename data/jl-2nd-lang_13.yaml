- en: Collections are objects that store and organize other objects. In this part
    you look at unique features and capabilities of collections, such as arrays, sets,
    and strings. However, you also delve into what is common across all collections,
    such as iterating over all the elements in a for loop and higher-order functions,
    such as map, filter, and reduce. I briefly covered collections in the part 1,
    but here I go deeper on each topic.

  zh: 集合是存储和组织其他对象的实体。在本部分中，您将了解集合的独特特性和功能，例如数组、集合和字符串。然而，您还将深入了解所有集合的共同点，例如在for循环中遍历所有元素以及高阶函数，如map、filter和reduce。我在第1部分中简要介绍了集合，但在这里我将更深入地探讨每个主题。
