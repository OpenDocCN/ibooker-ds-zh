- en: While I was working as the director of a large retailer, we started to build
    a data lake with all the information that could be collected (both inside and
    outside the enterprise) in order to get a 360-degree view of the customer (for
    marketing and other purposes). This would become a huge dataset incorporating
    customer data, syndicated sales data, shopping cart information, marketing (promo)
    data, demographics (from the US Census Bureau), store locations, weather, and
    so on.

  zh: 在我担任一家大型零售商的总监期间，我们开始建立一个数据湖，收集了所有可收集的信息（企业内部和外部），以便全面了解客户（用于营销和其他目的）。这将成为一个庞大的数据集，包括客户数据、联合销售数据、购物车信息、营销（促销）数据、人口统计学数据（来自美国人口普查局）、店铺位置、天气等等。
- en: This data lake would contain information on the who (shopper), what (product),
    where (location), when (time), how (transaction type), and why (external data
    such as weather, stock market, income around store locations, etc.). Its primary
    usage would be to support visualizations inside the Data CAFÉ (Collaborative Analytics
    Facility for the Enterprise). The Data CAFÉ was designed so that executives could
    enter this room with nine (9) large screen displays of information and make critical
    business decisions in real time (e.g., Black Friday sales on the East Coast allowed
    management to change distribution in the Mountain and West Coast time zones based
    on live feeds).

  zh: 这个数据湖将包含有关谁（购物者）、什么（产品）、在哪里（位置）、何时（时间）、如何（交易类型）和为什么（诸如天气、股市、周围店铺位置的收入等的外部数据）的信息。它的主要用途将是支持数据
    CAFÉ 内的可视化（企业协作分析设施）。数据 CAFÉ 被设计为，高管们可以进入这个带有9个大屏幕显示信息的房间，并实时做出关键业务决策（例如，东海岸的黑色星期五销售活动允许管理层根据实时反馈调整山区和西海岸的分销）。
- en: Inside the Data CAFÉ, we would slice and dice the data so that visualizations
    could be created with filters (specific store, state, region, etc.), and then
    simply by pushing this view to a different screen or dimension (e.g., from time
    to product), the executive could see whether something was a local trend or a
    larger one. We coined the term “Archimedes’s Visualizations” (as Archimedes was
    regarded as one of the leading scientists in classical antiquity).

  zh: 在数据 CAFÉ 内部，我们会对数据进行切片和切块，以便可以创建带有过滤器的可视化内容（特定店铺、州、地区等），然后通过将这个视图推送到不同的屏幕或维度（例如，从时间到产品），高管可以看到某些是否是地方趋势还是更大的趋势。我们创造了“阿基米德的可视化”这个术语（因为阿基米德被认为是古代经典时期的顶尖科学家之一）。
- en: Imagine that you could visualize information for a specific location (store)
    and then move to the next higher grouping (local market, state, division) and
    finally to global. Now consider that you were looking with these filters and that
    you could easily move these filters across to another monitor with when (time)
    or who (consumer) or what (product). Executives would be able to find their own
    trends based on their market experience and also have the advantage of data-driven
    decisions.

  zh: 想象一下，你可以为特定位置（店铺）可视化信息，然后转移到更高的组织层次（本地市场、州、区分），最终达到全球。现在考虑一下，当你使用这些过滤器查看时，你可以轻松地将这些过滤器移动到另一台显示器上，以查看何时（时间）、谁（消费者）或什么（产品）。高管们将能够根据他们的市场经验找到自己的趋势，并且还能通过数据驱动的决策获得优势。
- en: As the data integration started to mature, we quickly learned that this information
    could be used to find out very sensitive information about an individual or a
    household—specifically, what a neighbor was buying in our stores. This was instantly
    recognized as a problem when it came to data ethics, as data engineers and data
    scientists were going to be given access to the dataset for analysis. This could
    rapidly turn into a liability without some forms of control placed on the data
    lake.

  zh: 随着数据整合工作逐渐成熟，我们很快意识到这些信息可以用来获取有关个人或家庭非常敏感的信息，具体来说，就是了解邻居在我们店里购买了什么。当数据工程师和数据科学家被允许访问该数据集进行分析时，这一问题立即被认定为数据伦理的问题。如果不对数据湖施加一定的控制，这可能很快演变成一种责任。

    the return of datasets from queries made to the data lake:'

  zh: 为了解决这个问题，我们决定制定一套规则，限制从查询中返回数据湖的数据集：
- en: No query would be allowed that returned fewer than 30 results (since in the
    Midwest, small towns could have a population of 10, and thus the result set could
    be deterministic).
  id: totrans-10
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 不允许返回少于30个结果的任何查询（因为在中西部，小镇可能只有10个人口，因此结果集可能是确定性的）。
- en: No query would be permitted by name, address, phone number, or any other personally
    identifiable information (PII) such as loyalty identifier, IP address, and so
    forth.
  id: totrans-11

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 不允许按姓名、地址、电话号码或任何其他个人可识别信息（PII），如忠诚度标识符、IP地址等进行查询。
- en: No query would be supported that tracked the data or patterns of a unique individual
    or household (to stop the limited result set restriction from being bypassed).
  id: totrans-12
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 不支持跟踪唯一个人或家庭的数据或模式的任何查询（以防止绕过有限结果集限制）。
- en: All queries would be saved, so that if we found instances of ethical violations,
    we could stop them in the future while discussing with the query owner the reason
    for this type of interrogation (in case there was a real reason but the result
    set was deemed inappropriate).
  id: totrans-13
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 所有查询都将被保存，以便如果我们发现有道德违规行为，我们可以在未来阻止它们，并与查询所有者讨论此类询问的原因（以防确实有真正的原因，但结果集被认为是不合适的情况下）。
- en: As time went on, we were very surprised to learn that many attempts were made
    to access the data of individuals, and some used very innovative approaches, including
    multilevel queries and joined result sets. We did not understand why this was
    happening, as we had been very clear from the outset that this data lake would
    be used to find trends and determine how to improve the baskets of shoppers.

  zh: 随着时间的推移，我们非常惊讶地发现，许多尝试访问个人数据的企图，其中一些采用了非常创新的方法，包括多级查询和联合结果集。从一开始，我们就非常清楚，这个数据湖将用于发现趋势，并确定如何改进购物篮，但我们并不明白为什么会发生这种情况。
- en: As it turned out, upon investigation we found that many attempts were actual
    mistakes made in the query design, resulting in small result sets. Very few were
    found to be intentional, and this was after we reviewed the entire population
    of suspect queries. We had observed that the data engineers and scientists were
    mostly acting ethically, and this was no surprise, as the culture of the corporation
    was one of trust and personal responsibility.

  zh: 后来调查发现，许多尝试实际上是查询设计中的错误，导致结果集较小。很少数的是故意的，这是在我们审查了所有可疑查询的整个群体后得出的结论。我们注意到数据工程师和科学家们大多表现出了道德行为，这并不令人惊讶，因为公司的文化是信任和个人责任的体现。
