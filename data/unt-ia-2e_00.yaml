- en: I started programming games in 1982\. It wasn’t easy. We had no internet. Resources
    were limited to a handful of mostly terrible books and magazines that offered
    fascinating but confusing code fragments, and as for game engines—well, there
    weren’t any! Coding games was a massive uphill battle.

  zh: 我从1982年开始编程游戏。这并不容易。我们没有互联网。资源仅限于几本大多数都很糟糕的书和杂志，它们提供了迷人的但令人困惑的代码片段，至于游戏引擎——好吧，根本就没有！编写游戏是一场巨大的艰难斗争。
- en: How I envy you, reader, holding the power of this book in your hands. The Unity
    engine has done so much to open game programming up to so many people. Unity has
    managed to strike an excellent balance by being a powerful, professional game

    troupe run by a magician. He was kind enough to take me in and helped guide me
    toward becoming a good performer. “When you stand on a stage,” he pronounced,
    “you make a promise. And that promise is ‘I will not waste your time.’”

    none of your time and gets you coding fast—and not just nonsense code, but interesting

- en: I’ve been programming games for quite some time, but started using Unity only
    relatively recently. Unity didn’t exist when I first started developing games;
    the first version was released in 2005\. Right from the start, it had a lot of
    promise as a game development tool, but it didn’t come into its own until several
    versions later. In particular, platforms like iOS and Android (collectively referred
    to as *mobile*) didn’t emerge until later, and those platforms factor heavily
    into Unity’s growing prominence.

- en: Initially, I viewed Unity as a curiosity, an interesting development tool to
    keep an eye on but not actually use. During that time, I was programming games
    for both desktop computers and websites and doing projects for a range of clients.
    I was using tools like Blitz3D and Adobe Flash, which were great to program in
    but were limiting in a lot of ways. As those tools started to show their age,
    I kept looking for better ways to develop games.

    Flash这样的工具，编程起来很棒，但在很多方面都有局限性。随着这些工具开始显得过时，我一直寻找更好的游戏开发方法。
- en: I started experimenting with Unity around version 3 and then completely switched
    to it for my development work at Synapse Games. At first, I worked for Synapse
    on web games, but we eventually moved over to mobile games. And then we came full

    from one codebase!

- en: 'I’ve always seen sharing knowledge as important and have taught game development
    for several years. A large part of why I do this is the example set by my many

    I was first learning Unity. Among Unity’s many virtues is a huge treasure trove
    of learning resources, but those resources tend to take the form of unfocused
    fragments (like the script reference or isolated tutorials) and require much digging
    to find what you need. Ideally, I’d have a book that wrapped up everything I needed
    to know in one place and presented it in a clear and logical manner, so now I’m
    writing such a book for you. I’m targeting people who already know how to program
    but who are newcomers to Unity, and possibly new to game development in general.
    The choice of projects reflects my experience of gaining skills and confidence
    by doing a variety of freelance projects in rapid succession.

    a computer, I suggest going to one of the various “free interactive coding lessons”

    deliberately step you through developing your first game in Unity, the remaining
    chapters move a lot faster in order to take you through projects in multiple game
    genres. The book ends with a chapter describing deployment to various platforms
    including the web and mobile, but the main thrust of the book doesn’t make any
    reference to the ultimate deployment target because Unity is wonderfully platform-agnostic.

  zh: 关于封面插图
- en: The figure on the cover of *Unity in Action, Third Edition* is captioned “Habit
    of the Master of Ceremonies of the Grand Signior.” The Grand Signior was another
    name for a sultan of the Ottoman Empire. The illustration is taken from *A Collection
    of the Dresses of Different Nations, Ancient and Modern* by Thomas Jefferys, published
    in London between 1757 and 1772\. The title page states that these are hand-colored
    copperplate engravings, heightened with gum arabic. Jefferys (1719-1771) was called
    “Geographer to King George III.” An English cartographer who was the leading map
    supplier of his day, Jefferys engraved and printed maps for government and other
    official bodies and produced a wide range of commercial maps and atlases, especially
    of North America. His work as a mapmaker sparked an interest in local dress customs
    of the lands he surveyed, which are brilliantly displayed in this four-volume
    collection.

  zh: 《Unity in Action, 第三版》封面上的插图标题为“大苏丹的司仪习惯”。大苏丹是奥斯曼帝国苏丹的另一个称呼。这幅插图取自托马斯·杰弗里斯的《不同国家古今服饰汇编》，由伦敦1757年至1772年间出版。扉页声明这些是手工着色的铜版雕刻，用阿拉伯树胶增强。杰弗里斯（1719-1771）被称为“乔治三世的地理学家”。他是当时的领先地图供应商，为政府和其它官方机构雕刻和印刷地图，并制作了各种商业地图和地图集，尤其是北美地区的。他作为地图制作者的工作激发了他对所调查地区的当地服饰习俗的兴趣，这些习俗在这四卷集中得到了精彩的展示。
- en: Fascination with faraway lands and travel for pleasure were relatively new phenomena
    in the late 18th century, and collections such as this one were popular, introducing
    the tourist as well as the armchair traveler to the inhabitants of other countries.
    The diversity of the drawings in Jefferys’s volumes speaks vividly of the uniqueness
    and individuality of the world’s nations some 200 years ago. Dress codes have
    changed since then, and the diversity by region and country, so rich at the time,
    has faded away. It is now hard to tell the inhabitant of one continent apart from
    another. Perhaps, trying to view it optimistically, we have traded a cultural
    and visual diversity for a more varied personal life, or a more varied and interesting
    intellectual and technical life.

  zh: 对遥远土地的迷恋和为了娱乐而旅行在18世纪末是相对较新的现象，像这样的收藏品在当时很受欢迎，它们向游客和沙发旅行者介绍了其他国家的居民。杰弗里斯作品中的插图多样性生动地描绘了大约200年前世界各国独特性和个性的多样性。自那时以来，着装规范已经改变，当时丰富多样的地区和国家多样性已经逐渐消失。现在很难区分一个大陆的居民与另一个大陆的居民。或许，如果我们乐观地看待这个问题，我们是以文化和视觉多样性换取了更加丰富多彩的个人生活，或者更加丰富多彩和有趣的智力和技术生活。
- en: At a time when it is hard to tell one computer book from another, Manning celebrates
    the inventiveness and initiative of the computer business with book covers based
    on the rich diversity of regional life of two centuries ago, brought back to life
    by Jefferys’s pictures.
