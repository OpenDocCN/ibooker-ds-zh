- en: Looking back at my data journey, it’s really amazing how data management has
    evolved. I began working in the enterprise data warehouse (EDW) era. We were focused
    on building a “single source of the truth” that a company could rely on for decision-making,
    analytics, and reporting capabilities. Lots of money was spent on resources and
    infrastructure in order to rationalize/organize/store data, and to ensure it was
    deemed to be fit for use.

  zh: 回顾我的数据之旅，数据管理的演变真是令人惊叹。我开始在企业数据仓库（EDW）时代工作。我们致力于构建公司可以依赖的“真实数据源”，用于决策、分析和报告功能。大量资金投入资源和基础设施，以理性化/组织/存储数据，并确保其适合使用。
- en: Fast-forward, and companies switched gears and began embracing Big Data. The
    model shifted, as companies wanted to quickly analyze large datasets to determine
    whether value could be captured prior to spending time, money, and resources to
    organize and store the data. Companies believed that having huge quantities of
    data alone was a differentiator. They touted the size of their Hadoop clusters
    and hired armies of data scientists to find value in Big Data. At this juncture,
    ethics truly became a game changer in this space!

  zh: 快进到现在，公司转变方向，开始拥抱大数据。模式发生了转变，因为公司希望快速分析大数据集，以确定在投入时间、资金和资源之前是否能捕获价值。公司相信，仅仅拥有大量数据就足以区分自己。他们夸耀其Hadoop集群的规模，并雇佣大量数据科学家来在大数据中找到价值。在这个时刻，伦理道德真正成为了这个领域的游戏规则改变者！

- en: We’ve seen Facebook made the poster child for data privacy, with Mark Zuckerberg
    testifying on Capitol Hill. In essence, many Facebook users simply viewed Facebook
    as providing a free interface through which they could keep in touch with friends
    and family. Yes, Facebook does provide that user experience, but it is also a
    platform that is reposing lots of data about its user base. And it’s a highly
    profitable business, with revenues driven by advertising. Soon we would come to
    realize the magnitude of ethical concerns that exist here!

  zh: 我们看到Facebook成为数据隐私的典型代表，马克·扎克伯格在国会山作证。实际上，许多Facebook用户仅仅将其视为提供与朋友和家人保持联系的免费界面。是的，Facebook确实提供了这种用户体验，但它也是一个收集大量关于用户群体的数据的平台。它是一个极其有利可图的业务，收入主要来自广告。很快我们会意识到这里存在的伦理问题的重要性！
- en: Ethical concerns have led to regulations (GDPR and CCPA), and companies could
    face significant fines if their programs lack compliance and rigor. Storing Big
    Data (specifically, personally identifiable information [PII] and other sensitive
    data) is now being viewed as a risk. Great care is taken to partition and/or mask
    PII and other sensitive data.

  zh: 伦理关切导致了GDPR和CCPA等法规的出台，如果公司的程序缺乏合规性和严谨性，可能会面临重罚。现在存储大数据（特别是个人可识别信息[PII]和其他敏感数据）被视为一种风险。人们非常谨慎地对PII和其他敏感数据进行分区和/或掩码处理。
- en: To address regulations such as GDPR and CCPA, companies are very focused on
    providing transparency around data. They are creating data inventories/glossaries
    that include both business and technical metadata. Documenting data lineage and
    how the data propagates within the infrastructure is also a key component. Vendor
    solutions exist to help with this cataloging effort, and this key artifact is
    leveraged to facilitate audit activities.

  zh: 为了解决诸如GDPR和CCPA等法规，公司非常关注数据透明度问题。它们正在创建包含业务和技术元数据的数据清单/术语表。记录数据血统以及数据在基础设施内的传播方式也是关键组成部分。供应商解决方案可帮助进行此类目录化工作，并利用这一关键成果促进审计活动。

- en: A data breach in which PII/sensitive data is leaked has huge ramifications for
    a company! As such, companies are building out large cybersecurity organizations
    and equipping them with the latest and greatest shiny objects to keep infrastructures
    secure. Trust is such an important factor, and the brand reputation can take a
    big hit if customers’ sensitive data is compromised.

- en: In their efforts to stay ahead of the bad guys, cybersecurity organizations
    are embracing data and analytics to help mitigate risk. They are identifying infrastructure
    activity baselines and monitoring environments for activities that are outside
    of normal patterns. Many companies are leveraging AI to perform this analysis,
    and this bubbles up events that require the attention of security professionals.
    This filtering activity enables security professionals to focus on actual risks
    rather than having to mine all event data.

  zh: 为了在恶意行为之前保持领先，网络安全组织正在采用数据和分析来帮助减轻风险。他们正在识别基础设施活动的基线，并监控环境中不正常模式的活动。许多公司正在利用人工智能来进行此类分析，并筛选出需要安全专业人员关注的事件。这种过滤活动使安全专业人员能够专注于实际的风险，而不是必须挖掘所有事件数据。
- en: In summation, ethical issues are currently dominating the data landscape. Companies
    are trying to balance defensive activities (governance/privacy/security) with
    offensive strategies (data monetization). Risks around customer data are recognized,
    but companies are still determining their risk appetites in this area. Companies
    are taking this seriously while paying close attention to the regulations (GDPR
    and CCPA), and this will play a key role in determining what happens next.

  zh: 总结一下，伦理问题目前主导着数据领域。公司正在试图在防御性活动（治理/隐私/安全）与进攻性策略（数据变现）之间取得平衡。客户数据的风险被认可，但公司仍在确定它们在这一领域的风险偏好。公司正在认真对待这一问题，同时密切关注《GDPR》和《CCPA》等法规，这将在决定接下来发生什么方面起到关键作用。
- en: The amounts of data and types of data will certainly continue to grow and evolve.
    It will be very interesting to see how companies pivot their data strategies,
    and how they proceed with the management and oversight of data.
