- en: In August 2005, I was working in the analytics group for a major home improvement
    retailer based in North Carolina, and my father and his wife lived in New Orleans.
    When Hurricane Katrina hit the Southeast, I was able to see and assess the devastation
    from a personal, professional, and analytical perspective. Conversations with
    my family, my firsthand experiences volunteering, and visits to the New Orleans
    area after the storm gave my work more meaning by attaching names and faces to
    the results. I would remember the sights, sounds, and smells when I was back in
    my cube analyzing the data to capture the enormous impact of Katrina on our business.
    In addition, I found myself wondering what we as a company and as analysts could
    do to be more prepared in the future.

  zh: 2005年8月，我在北卡罗来纳州一家主要的家居改善零售商的分析团队工作，我的父亲和他的妻子住在新奥尔良。当卡特里娜飓风袭击东南部时，我能够以个人、专业和分析的角度看到和评估灾难。与家人的交谈，我亲身参与的志愿者经历，以及飓风过后访问新奥尔良地区的经历，让我的工作更具意义，因为我能够把名字和面孔与结果联系起来。当我回到办公室分析数据以捕捉卡特里娜对我们业务的巨大影响时，我会记住当时的景象、声音和气味。此外，我发现自己在思考作为一家公司和分析师，我们能够为未来做些什么以做好更充分的准备。
- en: Prior to the storm and immediately after the hurricane made landfall, the business
    trends were typical, and our emergency teams responded according to the protocols.
    We were analyzing which stores were affected and quantifying the lost sales by
    department. What was unique about Katrina was that the storm did not subside after
    it first made landfall in Florida. Instead, it gained strength in the Gulf and
    then hit New Orleans, and the storm surge caused the levees to fail. The amount
    of land, property, and people experiencing damage and destruction grew exponentially.
    Employees and customers lost their homes and belongings. Stores were closed or
    had limited hours due to building damage, loss of inventory, intermittent power,
    lack of staff, compromised municipal support, and the limitation of replenishing
    supplies. This situation was a worst-case scenario.

  zh: 风暴之前和飓风登陆后的那段时间，业务趋势都很典型，我们的应急团队按照协议进行响应。我们正在分析哪些商店受到影响，并量化各部门的销售损失。卡特里娜飓风的独特之处在于，风暴在首次登陆佛罗里达后并未减弱，而是在墨西哥湾加强，然后袭击了新奥尔良，风暴潮导致防洪堤溃堤。遭受损失和破坏的土地、财产和人口数量呈指数级增长。员工和顾客失去了他们的家园和财产。由于建筑损坏、库存损失、断断续续的电力、缺乏工作人员、市政支持不力以及补给有限，商店关闭或者营业时间有限。这种情况堪称最糟糕的情况。
- en: Before Katrina, we had built a best-in-class database that supported predictive
    models for purchase patterns, product affinities, seasonality, regionality, and
    sales forecasts. My team was truly on the leading edge of retail analytics. Now
    we were tasked with determining what data needed to be excluded from our existing
    processes so that the rest of the company could operate as usual.

  zh: 在卡特里娜飓风之前，我们建立了一个支持购买模式、产品亲和性、季节性、区域性和销售预测的最佳数据库。我的团队真正处于零售分析的领先地位。需要从我们现有的流程中排除，以便公司的其他部门可以像往常一样运作。
- en: At the same time, we realized that we had a true treasure at our fingertips.
    The excluded data could not be used to predict the normal business; however, it
    could be used to determine the key products and new patterns that would present
    in the database, providing a playbook for how our business evolves through a storm.
    In short, Hurricane Katrina gave data scientists an opportunity to analyze an
    epic disruption in the retail world and the ability to identify when the new normal
    was established.

  zh: 同时，我们意识到我们手中确实有一项真正的宝藏。被排除的数据无法用来预测正常的业务；然而，它却可以用来确定将出现在数据库中的关键产品和新模式，为我们业务如何通过风暴演变提供一本playbook。简言之，飓风卡特里娜为数据科学家提供了分析零售世界中史诗般混乱的机会，并能够确定新常态确立的时机。
- en: I realize that analyzing the “evolution of a storm” is making a huge jug of
    lemonade; however, it was a very exciting time and project. I started creating
    “bands” that identified the level of destruction in miles from the center of the
    storm outward to determine the line of normalcy. Over time, each band would reach
    its new normal. After four to five years, we had built a once-in-a-lifetime dataset—but
    what could we do with it?

  zh: 我意识到分析“风暴的演变”就像是制作一大罐柠檬汽水；然而，那是一个非常令人兴奋的时刻和项目。我开始创建“带状区域”，以确定从风暴中心向外的毁坏程度的级别，以确定正常状态的界线。随着时间的推移，每个带状区域都会达到它的新常态。经过四到五年的努力，我们建立了一个千载难逢的数据集——但我们能用它做些什么呢？

- en: We ran into a corporate budget question of whether to continue capturing and
    analyzing this “data gift” with the expense of retaining and maintaining it. Given
    that these events are rare, hard to predict, and even harder to act on quickly,
    the decision was made to let the data start rolling off the database naturally,
    using existing data-retention policies. I wonder if that dataset could have been
    used to improve storm preparedness, save lives and property, and improve disaster
    logistics, as it seems powerful storms are not as rare today.

  zh: 我们遇到了一个企业预算问题，即是否继续捕捉和分析这些“数据礼物”，并承担保留和维护它的费用。考虑到这些事件罕见、难以预测，甚至更难迅速采取行动，决定让数据按照现有的数据保留政策自然地从数据库中移除。我想知道这些数据集是否可以用来提高暴风雨准备工作、拯救生命和财产，并改进灾害后勤，因为今天强烈的风暴似乎并不罕见。
