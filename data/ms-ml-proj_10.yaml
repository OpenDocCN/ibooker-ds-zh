- en: Currently, there is an increasing trend for ML teams to manage their projects
    in production. This is called *shift left* because in a process flow, development
    teams are seen on the left-hand side passing products to support groups on the
    right-hand side. The idea is that the development groups should do more of the
    support group’s traditional work. This is because smaller companies are now supporting
    software development because there is less capital available to spend on production
    teams. Also, the move to the cloud means that a lot of the concerns of in-house
    support teams have disappeared. There are no server farms to tend and water, which
    makes it possible for huge savings simply by shutting them down.

- en: Of course, there are counter arguments. Why get ML teams to look after their
    systems in production when they could be building other ML systems? One answer
    is that sometimes the ML systems require specialist skills to sustain production.
    Another perspective is that there are valuable lessons to be learned from working
    with a system in the wild. Teams with exposure to maintaining production projects
    often have a different outlook on what’s important in future development processes.
    It’s also worth considering that the team supporting the project will naturally
    change as time progresses, and junior staff can gain experience as the first line
    of support for older deployments.

  zh: 当然，也有反论。为什么让机器学习团队负责生产中的系统，而不是让他们构建其他机器学习系统呢？一个答案是，有时机器学习系统需要专业技能来维持生产。另一个观点是，从与野外系统合作中可以学到宝贵的经验。经常维护生产项目的团队对未来开发过程中什么重要往往有不同的看法。还值得考虑的是，随着时间的推移，支持项目的团队自然会发生变化，初级员工可以作为一线支持为旧部署积累经验。
- en: Regardless of these arguments, providing support for a project when it is in
    production is often a prerequisite of ML projects. When presented with a project
    proposal, canny CIOs look down the road and see an orphaned project in the making.

    job, this chapter will address the challenges that supporting an ML system in

    early agile projects into production by Cunningham [1]. Since Cunningham introduced
    this idea, it has also come to describe the accumulation of problems and issues
    that tend to grow around computer systems in production over time. Software is
    static; it doesn’t change over time, and yet, the world changes around it. Typically,
    issues arise when we change the interfaces, leading to incomplete or failed interactions
    and data flows. Scully and co-authors point out that ML systems are particularly
    prone to technical debt [2], and there are several specific forms of technical
    debt that we need to address here.

    [2]，我们需要解决这里的一些具体形式的技术债务。
- en: The lack of a useful logging and monitoring system is a common form of technical
    debt in a legacy ML system. Our priorities need to include checking that logs
    that record the activity of the system exist, that there is a mechanism for understanding
    the performance of the system, and that there is a system of alerts to a support
    group if the system fails. Chapter 9 contains some advice for setting this up.
    This should be a priority because logs underpin any troubleshooting exercise,
    and getting an early warning of system failure can seriously reduce the stress

- en: At the time of writing (2022), ML research is creating considerable innovations
    in algorithm design. This is something that happens slowly in the rest of computer
    science and software engineering. In fact, the fast pace of research and development
    in the ML community creates technical debt as old approaches are out-modelled
    by the latest techniques. When taking on the maintenance of an ML system, it’s
    worth benchmarking its performance against newer techniques. In a few years, more
    robust and performative techniques will become available. Identifying opportunities
    to move from brittle and temperamental old models to robust and reliable new ones
    saves you and the team a lot of heartache. The latest and greatest, however, may
    be a matter of fashion, and the old models running in production can prove to
    be there for solid reasons. Using robust evaluation and model selection approaches
    as we discussed in chapter 8 can help to substantiate this, one way or another.

- en: As the world around the models evolves and changes, the models extracted in
    the past may become less and less applicable, even if the models contain solid
    causal relationships. When those relationships fail, the models fail. This is
    often called *concept drift*. For example, if customers buy smart trousers and
    shirts at the same time and then a global pandemic means that they work from home,
    their need for smart trousers disappears overnight! Recommending jeans or jogging
    trousers might be more effective, but the model may not have had the ability to
    adapt without intervention, and so its performance was compromised. A more common
    malady than a sudden causal change occurs when the noise levels and types of noise
    in the data flow to the model change. This can cause the model to make more errors

    onboard it into your working practice, but beware. Technologies that are introduced
    by an individual team member can become significant problems. They may represent
    a single point of failure and managing them in a long project when the most innovative
    team member may leave is challenging. In addition, it’s hard for you as a team
    manager to work your way into a position where you can justify and explain these
    choices to clients. A formal process can help to mitigate this.

    study. Hopefully, the client is open to the idea of being used as a reference
    in a case study, and often contracts provide for this potential. But if that was

    change the demonstration scenario from the client’s business domain to a different

- en: In either case, work is required to shift the focus of the project away from
    the detailed features of the actual implementation to the wider significance of
    how the problems were solved. This change of focus from solution to case study
