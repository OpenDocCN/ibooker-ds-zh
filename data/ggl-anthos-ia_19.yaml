  zh: B.1 简介
- en: Once upon a time “before the cloud,” many of us delivered infrastructure and
    platform services inside a mostly static data center. Most of the architecture
    and implementation work we did was based on first doing research, then a proof
    of concept and vendor selection. In most cases the real implementation work never
    got started till “the box” arrived and was racked and stacked. Quite the contrast
    to today where endless infrastructure is an API call and credit card away from
    our fingertips. Most of the most popular software is also available thanks to
    opensource and like-minded community members who work hard to continue to add
    features and functionality along the way. The barrier to getting started and running
    an experiment is very low, and we can make quick decisions based on trying something
    out rather than relying on extensive research or conducting a traditional RFP.
    This also enables a culture of being ok with failure and focusing on learning
    along the way to achieve the greater goal. You will hear people refer to this
    as “failing fast,” when conducting an experiment can be deemed successful even
    if it was perceived as a failure along the way. There is a high probability that
    you learned something valuable during the experiment.

  zh: 从前，“云”出现之前，我们中的许多人都是在主要静态的数据中心内部交付基础设施和平台服务。我们大部分的架构和实施工作都是基于先进行研究，然后是概念验证和供应商选择。在大多数情况下，真正的实施工作直到“箱子”到达并上架堆叠之前从未开始。这与今天的情况大相径庭，今天，无尽的基础设施只需一个API调用和一张信用卡就能触手可及。大多数最受欢迎的软件也得益于开源和志同道合的社区成员的共同努力，他们不断努力添加功能和功能。开始和运行实验的门槛非常低，我们可以通过尝试某事来快速做出决定，而不是依赖于广泛的研究或进行传统的RFP。这也使得我们能够接受失败，并专注于在实现更大目标的过程中学习。当进行实验时，即使它被视为过程中的失败，也可以被视为成功。在实验中，你很可能学到了一些有价值的东西。
- en: We should also recognize that much of the accelerated pace and development velocity
    is thanks to larger “cloud” and “enterprise” companies investing extensively in
    open source and software to move the needle forward. These investments allow us
    to consume vast amounts of open source software in a productised way with support
    and assurance. Those investing are committed to partnering with you along the
    way. It can be a complicated business model to invest in open source while delivering
    revenue from those investments, but the code has been cracked and Anthos is a
    great example of Google’s extensive investments paying off. Delivering turn key
    scalable cloud services to help us migrate, replatform and modernize our application

    the base to build upon and deliver enhanced managed cloud services. Kubernetes
    is the proven solid foundation that allows for many platform capabilities to enhance
    the overall user experience. As we dive into some lessons learned from real world
    Anthos implementations, we will focus on how to build on these foundational technologies

    technical aspects and capabilities of Anthos. As you can see, Anthos didn’t set
    out to be just another Kubernetes distribution you can run in your datacenter,
    or another cloud provider. GKE and the Kubernetes community laid much of the groundwork
    to enable us to look beyond individual applications and start to deliver platform
    services at scale, rather than taking a single application view. At the end of
    this book I hope you see Anthos as a platform play, a gateway to “cloud,” “cloud
    native thinking,” and a catalyst for modernizing enterprise business applications.
    Continuous improvement is a critical aspect to successfully implementing anything
    these days, and this chapter will try to pass on some lessons learned in the field

    and cloud platform services. The reality is that developing successful technology
    and bringing it to market is one thing, but achieving fundamental success that
    truly delivers business value requires looking at things from a different perspective.
    Think about your customers' experience, remembering customers can also be internal
    stakeholders and team members. Taking a customer approach to platform and application
    delivery helps us all focus on what matters, and what areas should be prioritized
    over others. The customer experience way of thinking starts to re-define the culture
    behind what we do and why we do it. We begin to ask ourselves, what are the principles
    and success criteria that will move the needle in the right direction for the
    business? And in the end, help realize the business case and investments that
    were made at the end of the day.

    culture. Culture can be a tricky word considering it can mean something different
    to everyone. But let’s look at it from the lens of how things get done, and how
    an organization determines priority and drives change. From the perspective of
    working in a startup, continuous improvement in the form of change comes with
    the territory, and in many cases the stakes and risks are much lower. The risks
    of not making big bold moves is much greater than getting comfortable with what’s
    in place today. If your teams don’t feel empowered, safe to push the envelope
    and think out of the box, you likely won’t survive and won’t change the market
    that you set out to disrupt. It’s never about building a better mousetrap, it’s

    start to get stuck and innovation suffers. Now on the contract this can also be
    an opportunity for a larger established enterprise business considering they also
    have a much greater capacity to absorb failure. As they learn to make smaller,

- en: This is not always an easy question to answer and finding the “sweet spot” is
    key to success. We set out to have the best of both worlds; we want a stable,
    secure platform to host our applications, but also need to innovate to stay competitive
    and take advantage of new business and market opportunities. These motivations
    will always pull against each other, and balance is critical to long term success.
    A popular strategy today is to start to think about getting closer to “cloud native”
    architecture and “cloud native” thinking. A simple way to understand this approach
    is to break applications into smaller parts, separate business logic into separate
    services. This allows you to start to develop, test, and release applications
    with less inter-dependencies. In the end, this should allow you to increase the
    velocity of features and functionality delivered to production. While this approach
    will not just deliver instant success, it takes a lot of work and a solid strategy
    that is aligned across your organization. It's been proven again and again to
    deliver great value to many large enterprise companies, and is definitely worth
    your consideration.

- en: The rest of this chapter will focus on sharing some lessons from the field when
    implementing new technologies such as Anthos, which don’t always set out with
    a strict set of requirements or goals. Many of these lessons come from implementation
    experience with large enterprise customers who are very well established and generally
    have long lasting business and technology processes. They have a desire to move
    fast and push the envelope, but also recognise that change is challenging for
    their organization, and a balanced approach needs to be taken for long term success.

  zh: 本章的其余部分将专注于分享在实施新技术（如Anthos）时的经验教训，这些技术并不总是以严格的设置要求或目标开始。许多这些经验教训来自与大型企业客户的实施经验，这些客户已经非常稳定，通常拥有长期的企业和技术流程。他们渴望快速行动并突破边界，但同时也认识到变化对他们组织来说是一项挑战，并且需要采取平衡的方法以实现长期成功。
- en: In many cases the initial goal is to embrace and adopt new technologies to move
    the business forward, but also maintain a balance between rate of change, stability
    and not having to change established business processes that are working to remediate
    risk. Another major consideration is taking a “security first” approach from Day1,
    nowadays with platforms that take a declarative automated approach to configuration
    security can be integrated right from the get go. A popular trend is security
    considerations and requirements being integrated into the configuration management
    workflow early. This also enables continuous feedback to platform users, enhanced
    developer experience and not to mention enforcement of security as part of the
    platform and application deployment workflow.

  zh: 利用服务网格实现一些快速胜利的最简单方法之一是利用高级遥测和对你应用及服务通信的可见性。服务网格可以详细捕捉和汇总你的应用通信和工作流程。这可以让你的团队能够轻松地排查性能问题，并开始为你的应用服务设定一些基本的服务级别。这种方法最好的部分是，你不需要对应用代码进行任何更改就能获得这些洞察，你还可以汇总这些数据并将其与平台日志相关联。Anthos
    Service Mesh 允许你在 GCP 控制台中管理所有这些数据和洞察，以增强你的运营洞察。从小处着手，利用基本功能，你可以在未来利用更多功能。

  zh: B.2.15 应用集成和迁移
- en: Ideally when you started your journey you had some applications and teams identified
    to participate in the journey. Rather than waiting till the platform was ready
    these stakeholders were part of the journey and also highly invested in the group's
    success. As much as we always try to plan for and for every situation there are
    always challenges and surprises that will come up. I would recommend making sure
    you are thinking about the application requirements early so you identify any
    surprises or challenges early. Try and identify some of the common use cases and
    make them part of the platform implementation early, think about some new application
    to on-board but also identify some other application that will be part of a migration.
    The more unique situation to take on early the better prepared you will be later
    as you look to move into production. The final aspect that will be important is
    to always keep an eye on the original business case. Are you on-track to achieve
    the initial goals and metrics you identified? Maybe it's time to tweak or go back
    to the business and validate any new assumptions or valuable lessons learned along
    the way.

  zh: 理想情况下，当你开始这段旅程时，你已经确定了一些应用和团队将参与其中。与其等待平台准备就绪，这些利益相关者应成为旅程的一部分，并且对团队的成功高度投入。尽管我们总是试图为每一种情况做计划，但总会有挑战和意外出现。我建议你尽早考虑应用需求，以便及早发现任何意外或挑战。尝试确定一些常见用例，并尽早将其纳入平台实施中，考虑一些新的应用以进行集成，但也确定一些将作为迁移一部分的其他应用。越早处理独特情况，你在准备进入生产阶段时就会越充分。最后一个重要方面是始终关注原始的商业案例。你是否在朝着实现你最初设定的目标和指标前进？也许现在是时候调整或回到商业领域，验证任何新的假设或沿途学到的宝贵经验了。

- en: 'As we onboard applications and ensure our platform and services will meet the
    needs of the business we can’t lose sight of the user community who will interact
    with and rely on the platform. We need to always think about the developer experience
    and remember one of the early definitions of success. Enhanced developer experience
    is sometimes hard to measure but is going to be extremely critical to the success
    of your platform and ability to onboard new applications and release new services.
    Don’t lose sight of one of the challenges we discussed before: that “change is
    hard” and it will take time and education for everyone to embrace these new ways
    of working. As we onboard application teams early let’s continue to communicate
    with the user community and create a continuous feedback loop. This early feedback
    will be very valuable as you start to explain your footprint and onboard new users
    and applications.'

  zh: 当我们上线应用并确保我们的平台和服务能够满足业务需求时，我们不能忽视将使用并依赖该平台的使用者社区。我们需要始终考虑开发者的体验，并记住成功的早期定义之一。增强开发者体验有时很难衡量，但对于你平台的成功以及上线新应用和发布新服务的能力将极为关键。不要忘记我们之前讨论的一个挑战：“改变是困难的”，并且需要时间和教育让每个人接受这些新的工作方式。当我们早期上线应用团队时，让我们继续与用户社区沟通，并创建一个持续的反馈循环。当你开始解释你的足迹并上线新用户和应用时，这种早期反馈将非常有价值。
- en: Another aspect to consider that we touched on earlier is “intelligent defaults.
    Realize that there will be very different levels of maturity in your user community.
    Obviously you will need to provide advanced teams the ability to make many custom
    configurations to meet their platform needs. Let’s also consider users that are
    new to the technology and initially may just be trying to get a simple application
    up and running. If these users need to consider every configuration option just
    to get started it might scare them away. Think about the minimum amount of decisions
    they need to make to deploy an application, create some intelligent defaults and
    make these decisions for them. As they get more comfortable with the platform
    they can start to make customization decisions. This will enhance the developer
    experience and help everyone see value early.

  zh: 另一个需要考虑的方面，我们之前也提到过，是“智能默认设置”。意识到你的用户社区中会有非常不同的成熟度水平。显然，你需要为高级团队提供能力，以便进行许多自定义配置以满足他们的平台需求。让我们也考虑那些对技术新手，最初可能只是尝试让一个简单的应用运行起来的用户。如果这些用户需要考虑每个配置选项才能开始，可能会吓跑他们。想想他们需要做出多少决定才能部署一个应用，创建一些智能默认设置，并为他们做出这些决定。随着他们对平台越来越熟悉，他们可以开始做出定制决策。这将增强开发者体验，并帮助每个人早期看到价值。

- en: Sometimes seeing is believing, a great demo can help others start to see and
    believe in what is possible with the platform you are building for the organization.
    Something to keep in mind is much of this new technology will be new to your team
    and organization. Start early on educating teams that will be involved and looking
    to interact with the new technology stack. Hands-on workshops can be a great way
    to help others get some technical experience, and having easy access to labs is
    also something that will deliver great benefits. Developing a culture of labbing
    and learning is something you are going to want to invest in and support. I think
    you will be surprised at what your teams will come up with when they are able
    to think out of the box. Lastly, don't forget about the business. Sometimes we
    tend to focus on the technical aspect but remember the real reason to do all this
    work is the”business benefits”.

  zh: 有时候眼见为实，一个出色的演示可以帮助他人开始看到并相信你所构建的组织平台上的可能性。需要记住的是，这些新技术对于你的团队和组织来说可能都是新的。尽早开始教育将参与其中并与新技术栈互动的团队。动手工作坊可以是一个帮助他人获得一些技术经验的好方法，而且能够轻松访问实验室也将带来巨大的好处。培养实验室和学习的文化是你将要投资和支持的事情。我想你会对你的团队在能够跳出思维定势时能想出什么感到惊讶。最后，别忘了商业方面。有时我们倾向于关注技术方面，但记住，做所有这些工作的真正原因是“商业效益”。

- en: Think of the front door as a framework to how others can leverage the platform.
    This needs to be a simple, easy to understand process. Try to build some user
    stories and think about how someone obtains access and makes use of the new technology.
    The more human interaction you can enable herer the better, but knowing this won’t
    always scale to meet the new demand. There are lots of things to think about and
    document from governance, security requirements, tooling standards and education.
    Those intelligent defaults we talked about will come in handy here, ideally those
    will help the user community meet the minimum requirement to get onboarded and
    in turn helping their communities.

  zh: 将前门视为一个框架，展示其他人如何利用这个平台。这个过程需要简单、易于理解。尝试构建一些用户故事，并思考某人如何获取访问权限并使用这项新技术。你能够促进更多的人际互动就越好，但要知道这并不总是能够扩展以满足新的需求。有很多事情需要考虑和记录，包括治理、安全要求、工具标准和教育。我们之前提到的那些智能默认设置在这里会很有用，理想情况下，这些将帮助用户社区达到最低要求以便加入，进而帮助他们的社区。

    teams involved and invested early you have a much better shot at success. Also
    if we look back at the initial success criteria there should be some compelling
    reason to push to prod. There are always some larger gates to pass but ideally
    the stakeholders who have to sign off were involved early and also invested in
