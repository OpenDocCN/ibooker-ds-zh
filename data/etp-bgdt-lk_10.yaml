    banks to increased opportunities for fraud, due both to the nature of the services
    and how these services are offered to customers. For example, online loan approvals

    benefits for existing customers, helping to retain these customers. Another approach

    changes in a more deliberate, stepwise, and careful manner, while others boldly
    disrupt how the organization operates. The reasons for differing paces and strategies
    may range from difficulties in changing culture rapidly to a desire to protect
    current core businesses while taking advantage of new opportunities. Some financial

    apply a gradual approach to their existing business but enable a disruptive approach

- en: Credit scoring is the go-to method for determining whether a consumer will pay
    back their debt. Historically, credit score calculations required payment history,
    a statement of outstanding debts, history of recent credit enquiries, and so on.
    Bank staff would analyze the results thoroughly to determine risk and profitability
    levels. The risks of a consumer having specific credit scores such as 550 or 710
    are well understood. But now, banks want to expand the applications of a score
    to a wider population that lacks adequate data for a traditional credit score.
    This is called the “financial inclusion problem,” and it’s not just an issue in
    developing nations; it also exists in the United States. As illustrated by [Figure 10-3](#classification_of_bankable_population),
    55 million of a 325-million US population cannot be scored and face barriers to
    being considered bankable. They end up overpaying for basic, everyday financial

    cannot be scored using traditional methods is even larger. The percentage in the
    US is roughly 17%. In India, it is roughly 19%, or 250 million people. Another
    large portion of the population in India, some 700 million, are also considered
    non-credit seekers. Aadhaar, which I mentioned earlier, is targeted to enable
    a more significant portion of this population to participate in the financial
    system. To be able to extend credit to these large groups of people, banks are
    considering additional data sources such as bill payment data, along with non-financial
    data such as social networks, mobile data, retail purchases, education, and public
    records, to establish creditworthiness. Such calculations require synthesis and
    analysis of a wide variety of data sources, and ultimately consumer delivery mechanisms
    to operationalize results from the data analysis. There are also significant privacy
    implications in the collection, centralized storage, and use of these diverse

  zh: 另一项正在追赶并被用作战略变革载体的革命性技术是物联网（IoT），一些保险公司正在采纳并看到其价值。大数据分析快速采纳的一个关键因素是它与连接设备的直接联系，收集数据点并将其转化为可操作的分析信息。
- en: The IoT, for instance, can benefit insurance providers as well as insured people
    in the areas of health. By monitoring one’s health, vital signs, and general well-being,
    devices can satisfy an individual’s desire for health-related metrics while providing
    valuable data to insurance companies to better analyze morbidity and mortality.
    This provides an opportunity to come up with innovative products catering to varied
    risk classes that may have previously been out of scope.

    does not have a cataclysmic impact on an industry; instead, there is always a
    ripple effect. Once again, health provides a major example. There is a considerable
    focus (with billions of dollars of US government subsidies) on the digitization
    of healthcare and biometric records. Projects such as the [Precision Medicine
    Initiative](https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/primer/precisionmedicine/initiative) seek
    to build a unified, global platform of services between public and private companies
    to share customer medical records in a secure and efficient manner. This in itself
    in the near future will help bridge the gap between consumers, the healthcare
    industries, and insurance companies. The broader impact would be the introduction
    of products and services for the uninsured and those outside of the explored risk
    classes.

    to come by until the current generation of big data technology. Excel is a great

    to today’s smart cities. Relational systems could scale enough, but combining
    and harmonizing data from different systems was too difficult and expensive. With
    big data technology that provides inexpensive storage and flexible schemas, it
    is now possible to combine data across many different systems, in many different
    formats, and invest in extracting, harmonizing, and cleaning only the parts that
    are required for a specific project. The scalability of big data makes it possible
    to implement IoT projects with billions of GPS events, while the ability to store
    and process massive amounts of data affordably is a big deal for cities where
    budgets are strained. For example, the ability to reuse old machines and use disparate
    hardware to build Hadoop clusters inexpensively is an important cost-saving advance.
