- en: A deep learning system can be assumed to be efficient if it can bridge two different
    worlds—research and prototyping with production operations. Teams who design such
    systems must be able to communicate with practitioners across these two worlds
    and work with the different sets of requirements and constraints that come from
    each. This requires a principled understanding of how the components in deep learning
    systems are designed and how they are expected to work in tandem. Very little
    of the existing literature covers this aspect of deep learning engineering. This
    information gap becomes an issue when junior software engineers are onboarded
    and expected to become effective deep learning engineers.

  zh: 一个深度学习系统如果能够连接两个不同的世界——研究和原型设计与生产操作，那么我们可以认为它是高效的。设计此类系统的团队必须能够与这两个世界中的从业者进行沟通，并处理来自每个世界的不同需求和约束。这需要从根本上理解深度学习系统中各个组件的设计方式以及它们如何协同工作。现有的文献中关于深度学习工程这一方面的内容非常少。当新入职的软件工程师被期望成为有效的深度学习工程师时，这一信息差距成为一个问题。
- en: Over the years, engineering teams have filled this void by using their acquired
    experience and ferreting out what they need to know from the literature. Their
    work has helped traditional software engineers build, design, and extend deep
    learning systems in a relatively short amount of time. So it was with great excitement
    that I learned that Chi and Donald, both of whom have led deep learning engineering
    teams, have taken the very important initiative of consolidating this knowledge
    and sharing it in the form of a book.

- en: A little more than a decade ago, we had the privilege of building some early
    end user–facing product features that were powered by artificial intelligence.
    It was a huge undertaking. Collecting and organizing data that would be fit for
    model training was not a usual practice at that time. Few machine learning algorithms
    were packaged as ready-to-use libraries. Performing experiments required running
    management manually and building out custom workflows and visualizations. Custom
    servers were made to serve each type of model. Outside of resource-intensive tech
    companies, almost every single new AI-powered product feature was built from scratch.
    It was a far-reaching dream that intelligent applications would one day become
    a commodity.

  zh: 十多年前，我们有幸构建了一些早期面向最终用户的人工智能产品功能。这是一项巨大的任务。收集和组织适合模型训练的数据在当时并不是一种常见的做法。当时很少有机器学习算法被打包成现成的库。进行实验需要手动运行管理，并构建自定义的工作流程和可视化。为每种类型的模型制作了定制服务器。在资源密集型技术公司之外，几乎每个新的AI产品功能都是从头开始构建的。这是一个遥远的梦想，智能应用有一天将成为一种商品。
- en: After working with a few AI applications, we realized that we had been repeating
    a similar ritual each time, and it seemed to us that it made more sense to design
    a systematic way, with prototyping, for delivering AI product features to production.
    The fruit of this effort was PredictionIO, an open source suite of framework software
    that put together state-of-the-art software components for data collection and
    retrieval, model training, and model serving. Fully customizable through its APIs
    and deployable as services with just a few commands, it helped shorten the time
    required at every stage, from running data science experiments to training and
    deploying production-ready models. We were thrilled to learn that developers around
    the world were able to use PredictionIO to make their own AI-powered applications,
    resulting in some amazing boosts to their businesses. PredictionIO was later acquired
    by Salesforce to tackle a similar problem on an even larger scale.

    there have been some recurring questions. Why is our deep learning system designed
    the way it is? Is this the best design for other specific use cases? We noticed
    that junior software engineers were the ones most often asking these questions,
    and we interviewed a few of them to find out why. They revealed that their conventional
    software engineering training did not prepare them to work effectively with deep
    learning systems. And when they looked for learning resources, they found only
    scant and scattered information on specific system components, with hardly any
    resources discussing the fundamentals of the software components, why they were

    to quickly ramp up new teammates and allowed traditional software engineers with
    no prior experience in building deep learning systems to get up to speed. We decided

- en: But the model does not act alone. To bring a product or service to fruition,
    a model needs to be situated within a system or platform (we use these terms interchangeably)
    that supports the model with various services and stores. It needs, for instance,
    an API, a dataset manager, and storage for artifacts and metadata, among others.

    with designing the deep learning system and components have only a cursory knowledge
    of deep learning. They do not understand the specific requirements that deep learning
    needs from system engineering, so they tend to follow generic approaches when
    building the system. For example, they might choose to abstract out all work related
    to deep learning model development to the data scientist and only focus on automation.
    So the system they build relies on a traditional job scheduling system or business
    intelligence data analysis system, which is not optimized for how deep learning
    training jobs are run, nor for deep learning-specific data access patterns. As
    a result, the system is hard to use for model development, and model shipping
    velocity is slow. Essentially, engineers who lack a profound understanding of
    deep learning are being asked to build systems to support deep learning models.

    but you should be familiar with basic computer science concepts and coding tools,
    such as microservices, gRPC, and Docker, to run the lab and understand the technical
    material. No matter your background, you can still benefit from the book’s nontechnical
    material to help you better understand how machine learning and deep learning
    systems work to bring products and services from ideas into production.

    book. The first chapter explains what a deep learning project development cycle
    is and what a basic deep learning system looks like. The next chapters dive into
    each functional component of the reference deep learning system. Finally, the

- en: We believe the best way to learn is by doing, practicing, and experimenting.
    To demo the design principles explained in this book and provide hands-on experience,
    we created a sample deep learning system and code lab. All the source code, set-up
    instructions, and lab scripts of the sample deep learning system are available
    on GitHub ([https://github.com/orca3/MiniAutoML](https://github.com/orca3/MiniAutoML)).
    You can also obtain executable snippets of code from the liveBook (online) version
    of this book at [https://livebook.manning.com/book/software-engineers-guide-to-deep-learning-system-design](https://livebook.manning.com/book/software-engineers-guide-to-deep-learning-system-design)

    code is also **`in bold`** to highlight code that has changed from previous steps
    in the chapter, such as when a new feature adds to an existing line of code.

    many of the listings, highlighting important concepts.
