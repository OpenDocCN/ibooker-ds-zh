    on the fly that does its primary job in the short term but is unwieldy and inefficient
    to maintain and scale in the long term. It is time we also become familiar with
    its shadow twin: fairness debt.'

  zh: 技术债务是一个熟悉的概念。它用来描述临时创建的简单代码，在短期内完成其主要任务，但在长期内维护和扩展起来不灵活和低效。现在是时候熟悉其暗影双胞胎——公平债务了。
- en: Just like its technical counterpart, we incur fairness debt when we build systems
    that work for our current situation and user base today but that have unintended
    consequences lurking underneath the surface as we continue to deploy the solutions
    tomorrow.

  zh: 就像技术的对应物一样，当我们构建系统以满足今天的情况和用户群体，但未来继续部署解决方案时，会产生意外后果，从而产生公平债务。
- en: One way to incur fairness debt is by optimizing our systems and algorithms for
    a particular performance metric without constraints. Data scientists and technologists
    make these types of optimization choices deliberately and often, even if naively.

  zh: 通过为特定性能指标优化我们的系统和算法而不加以约束，我们可以产生公平债务。数据科学家和技术人员经常会有意无意地做出这些类型的优化选择。
- en: But optimization often carries a fairness debt when taken to its natural progression.
    A [Google Ventures post](https://oreil.ly/5fIqQ), for example, suggests optimizing
    for the amount of time users spend watching videos on your app. While at first
    this may seem a perfectly rational way to focus engineering efforts, it can get
    out of control when usage becomes excessive, to the detriment of the user. As
    a friend managing AI products at Amazon said, “It is OK when a company is trying
    to get a user to go from spending seven to eight minutes a day on their app. It
    is a whole different game when some users are risking going from seven to eight
    hours a day.”

  zh: 但是当优化进展自然进行时，通常会带来公平债务。例如，[Google Ventures的一篇文章](https://oreil.ly/5fIqQ)建议优化用户在您的应用上观看视频的时间。起初，这可能是一种完全合理的工程努力集中方式，但当使用量过多时，可能会对用户造成损害。正如亚马逊的AI产品经理所说：“当公司试图让用户从每天花费七分钟到八分钟在他们的应用上时，这是可以接受的。但当一些用户冒着从每天花费七小时到八小时的风险时，情况完全不同。”
- en: At first, fairness debts are paid not by the company but by users or society.
    But once they get big enough, they bite our collective asses. The backlash against
    the companies producing smartphones and apps optimized to capture attention—and
    the real headwinds these businesses are facing from both a user and a regulatory
    standpoint—is evidence that debts can be postponed but not forgiven.

  zh: 起初，公平债务不是由公司而是由用户或社会承担。但一旦它们变得足够大，就会影响我们所有人。针对那些优化以吸引注意力的智能手机和应用的公司的反弹——以及这些企业在用户和监管方面所面临的真正逆风——是债务可以推迟但无法原谅的证据。
- en: Going beyond “attention optimization,” imagine a more sinister scenario in which
    you have a fintech company optimizing only for the profitability of the loans
    getting approved. It is easy to imagine a situation in which you end up with something
    like algorithmic redlining, and [researchers at UC Berkeley have found evidence
    of that](https://oreil.ly/mjawc). Their research shows fintech lenders costing
    Latino and African American mortgage refinance borrowers a combined $765 million
    yearly, partially due to impermissible discrimination.

- en: Imagine, as happened with Upstart, that you are a fintech founder or technologist,
    waking up to a message from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) that
    mentions a review of your fair lending practices, only a couple of years after
    you launched your product.^([1](ch40.xhtml#ch01fn39)) You might have been “moving
    fast and breaking things” and focused only on improving your tech and growing
    your business. But you are in a highly regulated industry, and there is growing
    interest in the unintended consequences of what you do. For instance, [Senators
    Elizabeth Warren and Doug Jones are sending letters to the Federal Reserve, the
    Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), and the CFPB](https://oreil.ly/ZkqE2)
    asking about their regulatory stance on algorithm-based lending.

  zh: 想象一下，就像 Upstart 遇到的情况一样，作为一名金融科技创始人或技术专家，你醒来后收到了消费者金融保护局（CFPB）的一条消息，提到对你的公平借贷实践进行审查，而这发生在你的产品上市仅仅几年之后。^([1](ch40.xhtml#ch01fn39))
    你可能一直在“快速前进、破坏事物”，只专注于改进技术和扩展业务。但你处在一个高度监管的行业中，人们对你所做事情的意外后果越来越感兴趣。例如，[伊丽莎白·沃伦参议员和道格·琼斯参议员正在致函联邦储备委员会、联邦存款保险公司（FDIC）和CFPB](https://oreil.ly/ZkqE2)，询问他们在基于算法的贷款监管立场。

    of fairness debt occurring. But Upstart took it seriously and did not let the
    debt happen.

- en: Upstart AI-based models, careful to be fair from the start, have shown fantastic
    results—so good that [the CFPB took the unusual step of widely sharing how well
    they were performing](https://oreil.ly/eiyMH). Upstart was able to approve 23–29%
    more applicants than the traditional lending model, with 15–17% lower interest
    rates across every tested race, ethnicity, and gender group. In addition, young
    adults were 32% more likely to get approved for loans, and people with incomes
    under $50,000 got approved 13% more.

  zh: Upstart 的 AI 模型从一开始就非常注重公平，显示出了惊人的成果——以至于[CFPB 采取了罕见的举措广泛分享它们的表现有多好](https://oreil.ly/eiyMH)。Upstart
    能够批准比传统贷款模型多 23–29% 的申请人，且在每个经过测试的种族、族裔和性别群体中，利率降低了 15–17%。此外，年轻成年人获批贷款的可能性提高了
    32%，收入低于 5 万美元的人群的贷款批准率提高了 13%。
- en: As with technical debt, incurring fairness debt is a choice, not an inevitability.
    Pay it off early and often, or better yet, do not incur it at all. It is the right
    choice. AI explainability approaches, like what Upstart used and companies such
    as Fiddler Labs produce, can help with this process. In a world where our technologies
    and algorithms will be increasingly under scrutiny, companies that are careful
    about avoiding fairness debt will get rewarded.
