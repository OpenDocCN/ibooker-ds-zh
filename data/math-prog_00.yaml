    I founded that builds predictive analytics software for oil and gas companies.
    By that time, we had finished building our core product: a fluid-flow simulator
    powered by physics and machine learning, along with an optimization engine. These
    tools let our customers look into the future of their oil reservoirs and helped
    them to discover hundreds of millions of dollars of optimization opportunities.'

  zh: 我在2017年开始写这本书，当时我是Tachyus公司的CTO，这是我创立的一家为石油和天然气公司构建预测分析软件的公司。到那时，我们已经完成了核心产品的构建：一个由物理和机器学习驱动的流体流动模拟器，以及一个优化引擎。这些工具让我们的客户能够看到他们石油储量的未来，并帮助他们发现数亿美元优化机会。
- en: My task as CTO was to productize and scale-out this software as some of the
    biggest companies in the world began to use it. The challenge was that this was
    not only a complex software project, but the code was very mathematical. Around
    that time, we started hiring for a position called “scientific software engineer,”
    with the idea that we needed skilled professional software engineers who also
    had solid backgrounds in math, physics, and machine learning. In the process of
    searching for and hiring scientific software engineers, I realized that this combination
    was both rare and in high demand. Our software engineers realized this as well
    and were eager to hone their math skills to contribute to our specialized back-end
    components of our stack. With eager math learners on our team already, as well
    as in our hiring pipeline, I started to think about the best way to train a strong
    software engineer to become a formidable math user.

  zh: 作为CTO，我的任务是使这款软件产品化并扩展规模，因为世界上一些最大的公司开始使用它。挑战在于，这不仅是一个复杂的软件项目，而且代码非常数学化。大约在那个时期，我们开始招聘一个名为“科学软件工程师”的职位，我们的想法是需要有数学、物理和机器学习扎实背景的熟练专业软件工程师。在寻找和招聘科学软件工程师的过程中，我意识到这种组合既罕见又需求量大。我们的软件工程师也意识到了这一点，并渴望提高他们的数学技能，为我们的堆栈的专业后端组件做出贡献。在我们团队中已经有一些热切的数学学习者，以及在我们的招聘渠道中，我开始思考如何最好地训练一个强大的软件工程师，使他成为一个强大的数学使用者。
- en: I realized there were no books with the right math content, presented at the
    right level. While there are probably hundreds of books and thousands of free
    online articles on topics like linear algebra and calculus, I’m not aware of any
    I could hand to a typical professional software engineer, and expect them to come
    back in a few months having mastered the material. I don’t say this to disparage
    software engineers, I just mean that reading and understanding math books is a
    difficult skill to learn on its own. To do so, you often need to figure out what
    specific topics you need to learn (which is hard if you don’t know anything about
    the material yet!), read them, and then choose some high quality exercises to
    practice applying those topics. If you were less discerning, you could read every
    word of a textbook and solve *all* of its exercises, but it could take months
    of full-time study to do that!

  zh: 所有这些问题都迫使我更加仔细地思考哪些是可实现的。我将分享我们回答这些问题的几种方法，因为这将帮助你确切地了解这本书是如何运作的。
- en: First, I decided to focus this book around one core skill--expressing mathematical
    ideas in code. I think this is a great way to learn math, even if you aren’t a
    programmer by trade. When I was in high school, I learned to program on my TI-84
    graphing calculator. I had the grand idea that I could write programs to do my
    math and science homework for me, giving me the right answer *and* outputting
    the steps along the way. As you might expect, this was more difficult than just
    doing my homework in the first place, but it gave me some useful perspective.
    For any kind of problem I wanted to program, I had to clearly understand the inputs
    and outputs, and what happened in each of the steps of the solution. By the end,
    I was sure I knew the material, and I had a working program to prove it.

  zh: 首先，我决定将这本书的重点放在一个核心技能上——用代码表达数学思想。我认为这是一种学习数学的好方法，即使你不是程序员。当我还在高中时，我在我的TI-84图形计算器上学习编程。我有一个宏伟的想法，那就是我可以编写程序来做我的数学和科学作业，给出正确答案，并且在过程中输出步骤。正如你可能预料的那样，这比最初做作业要困难得多，但它给了我一些有用的视角。对于任何我想编程的问题，我必须清楚地理解输入和输出，以及解决方案的每个步骤中发生了什么。到最后，我确信我掌握了这些材料，并且有一个可以证明的运行程序。
- en: That’s the experience I’ll try to share with you in this book. Each chapter
    is organized around a tangible example program, and to get it working, you need
    to put all the mathematical pieces together correctly. Once you’re done, you’ll
    have confidence that you’ve understood the concept and can apply it again in the
    future. I’ve included plenty of exercises to help you check your understanding
    on the math and code I’ve included, as well as mini-projects which invite you
    to experiment with new variations on the material.

- en: Another question I discussed with Manning was what programming language I should
    use for the examples. Originally, I wanted to write the book in a functional programming
    language because math is a functional language itself. After all, the concept
    of a “function” originated in math, long before computers even existed. In various
    parts of math, you have functions that return other functions like integrals and
    derivatives in calculus. However, asking readers to learn an unfamiliar language
    like LISP, Haskell, or F# *while* learning new math concepts would make the book
    more difficult and less accessible. Instead, we settled on Python, a popular,
    easy-to-learn language with great mathematical libraries. Python also happens
    to be a favorite for “real world” users of math in academia and in industry.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 我还与曼宁讨论了另一个问题，那就是我应该使用哪种编程语言来编写示例。最初，我想用一种函数式编程语言来写这本书，因为数学本身就是一种函数式语言。毕竟，“函数”的概念起源于数学，在计算机甚至存在之前就已经存在了。在数学的各个部分，你都有函数，比如微积分中的积分和导数。然而，要求读者在学习新数学概念的同时学习像LISP、Haskell或F#这样的不熟悉的语言，会使这本书更难懂，也更难接近。因此，我们决定使用Python，这是一种流行、易于学习的语言，拥有出色的数学库。Python也恰好是学术界和工业界“现实世界”数学用户的喜爱。
- en: 'The last major question that I had to answer with Manning was what specific
    math topics I would include and which ones wouldn’t make the cut. This was a difficult
    decision, but at least we agreed on the title *Math for Programmers*, the broadness
    of which gave us some flexibility for what to include. My main criterion became
    the following: this was going to be “Math for Programmers,” not “Math for Computer
    Scientists.” With that in mind, I could leave out topics like discrete math, combinatorics,
    graphs, logic, Big O notation, and so on, that are covered in computer science
    classes and mostly used to *study* programs.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 最后一个我必须与曼宁一起回答的问题是，我会包括哪些具体的数学主题，哪些主题不会入选。这是一个艰难的决定，但至少我们在标题上达成了共识，即《程序员数学》，这个标题的广泛性给了我们一些灵活性，关于可以包含什么内容。我的主要标准变成了以下这个：这将是一本“程序员数学”，而不是“计算机科学家数学”。考虑到这一点，我可以省略离散数学、组合数学、图论、逻辑、大O符号等主题，这些主题在计算机科学课程中有所涉及，并且主要用于*研究*程序。
- en: Even with that decision made, there was still plenty of math to choose from.
    Ultimately, I chose to focus on linear algebra and calculus. I have some strong
    pedagogical views on these subjects, and there are plenty of good example applications
    in both that can be visual and interactive. You can write a big textbook on either
    linear algebra *or* calculus alone, so I had to get even more specific. To do
    that, I decided the book would build up to some applications in the trendy field
    of machine learning. With those decisions made, the contents of the book became
    clearer.

  zh: 即使做出了这个决定，仍有大量的数学可以选择。最终，我选择专注于线性代数和微积分。我对这些主题有一些强烈的教学法观点，而且在这两个主题中都有许多好的示例应用，这些应用可以是视觉的，也可以是交互式的。你可以单独写一本关于线性代数或微积分的大部头教科书，所以我必须更加具体。为了做到这一点，我决定这本书将逐步构建到机器学习这一热门领域的某些应用中。做出了这些决定后，本书的内容变得更加清晰。

    while a 2D world is flat like a piece of paper or a computer screen. A location
    in 2D can be described by two numbers (often called *x* and *y*-coordinates),
    while you need three numbers to identify a location in 3D. We can’t picture a
    17-dimensional space, but we can describe its points by lists of 17 numbers. Lists

    *x* 和 *y* 坐标）来描述，而在三维空间中识别一个位置则需要三个数字。我们无法想象17维空间，但我们可以用17个数字的列表来描述其点。这样的数字列表被称为
    *向量*，向量数学有助于阐明“维度”的概念。'
- en: '*Spaces of functions--*Sometimes a list of numbers can specify a function.
    With two numbers like *a* = 5 and *b* = 13, you can create a (linear) function
    of the form *f*(*x*) = *ax* + *b*, and in this case, the function would be *f*(*x*)
    = 5*x* + 13\. For every point in 2D space, labeled by coordinates (a, b), there’s
    a linear function that goes with it. So we can think of the set of all linear
    functions as a 2D space.'

- en: '*Derivatives and gradients*--These are calculus operations that measure the
    rates of change of functions. The *derivative* tells you how rapidly a function
    *f*(*x*) is increasing or decreasing as you increase the input value *x*. A function
    in 3D might look like *f*(*x*, *y*) and can increase or decrease as you change
    the values of either *x* or *y*. Thinking of (*x*, *y*) pairs as points in a 2D
    space, you could ask what direction you could go in this 2D space to make *f*
    increase most rapidly. The gradient answers this question.'

    *f* 增加得最快。梯度回答了这个问题。'
- en: '*Optimizing a function--*For a function of the form *f*(*x*) or *f*(*x*, *y*),
    you could ask an even broader version of the previous question: what inputs to
    the function yield the biggest output? For *f*(*x*), the answer would be some
    value *x*, and for *f*(*x*, *y*), it would be a point in 2D. In the 2D case, the
    gradient can help us. If the gradient tells us *f*(*x*, *y*) is increasing in
    some direction, we can find a maximum value of *f*(*x*, *y*) if we explore in
    that direction. A similar strategy applies if you want to find a minimum value

    transformations, and matrices; these are the bread and butter of the subject of
    linear algebra. In part 2, it introduces calculus with a focus on a few particularly
    useful subjects for programmers: derivatives, gradients, Euler’s method, and symbolic
    evaluation. Finally, in part 3, all the pieces come together to show you how some
    important machine learning algorithms work. By the last chapter of the book, you’ll
    have learned enough math to code-up your own neural network from scratch.'

    4, and so on. Computer code is not always written “in order” like this. That is,
    the simplest ideas in a finished computer program are not always in the first
    lines of the first file of the source code. This difference makes it challenging

- en: My solution to this is to include a “walkthrough” code file in the form of a
    Jupyter notebook for each chapter. A Jupyter notebook is something like a recorded
    Python interactive session, with visuals like graphs and images built in. In a
    Jupyter notebook, you enter some code, run it, and then perhaps overwrite it later
    in your session as you develop your ideas. The notebook for each chapter has code
    for each section and subsection, run in the same order as it appears in the book.
    Most importantly, this means you can run the code for the book as you read. You
    don’t need to get to the end of a chapter before your code is complete enough
    to work. Appendix A shows you how to set up Python and Jupyter, and appendix B
    includes some handy Python features if you’re new to the language.
