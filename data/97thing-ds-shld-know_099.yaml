- en: Advances in AI technology have led to justified calls for banning lethal autonomous
    weapons systems (LAWS). Governments worldwide answer these calls with silence.
    When countries, methods of governance, and lives are at stake, leaders resort
    to extreme methods to ensure survival and protect their citizenry. In the future
    of warfare, the ability of LAWS to assess and engage targets quickly will give
    a decisive advantage to the country that possesses the most advanced technology
    and a willingness to use it. In warfare, the technology required to win prevails.
    Considering these stark realities, what degree of certainty do AI machines require
    to engage targets autonomously? The following is a methodology that practitioners
    can use to dictate how much freedom to give autonomous systems in making or informing
    vital decisions.

  zh: AI技术的进步引发了对禁止致命自主武器系统（LAWS）的正当呼吁。全球各国政府对这些呼吁沉默以对。当国家、治理方法和生命岌岌可危时，领导者们会采取极端措施以确保生存并保护其公民。在未来的战争中，LAWS快速评估和参与目标的能力将为拥有最先进技术并愿意使用的国家提供决定性优势。在战争中，获胜所需的技术必定占据主导地位。考虑到这些鲜明的现实，AI机器需要多大程度的确证才能自主参与或通知重要决策？以下是从业者可用来决定在自主系统中给予多少自由度的方法论。

  zh: 性能期望方法（PEM）
- en: A model trained on one set of data and tested on a separate set of data has
    a baseline metric for accuracy that may not be representative of real-world scenarios.
    The PEM is designed to test LAWS in a manner representative of real-world scenarios
    and should serve as the baseline for testing requirements that LAWS must pass
    before they are deployed to make independent decisions. Much as a doctor who achieves
    excellent grades over the course of medical school must still complete a residency,
    so too should LAWS undergo a rigorous trial period.

  zh: 在一组数据上训练并在另一组数据上测试的模型具有准确性的基准指标，可能不代表真实场景。PEM旨在以代表真实场景的方式测试LAWS，并应作为LAWS在独立决策前必须通过的测试要求的基准。就像一名在医学院期间表现优异的医生仍需完成住院医师培训一样，LAWS也应经历严格的试用期。
- en: 'The PEM consists of two components: testing environment (TE) and output accuracy
    metric (OAM). The TE is designed to mimic real-world scenarios. For instance,
    a LAWS built to identify enemy artillery could be tested in a TE containing friendly
    and enemy equipment, test dummies, and other non-enemy artillery objects. The
    performance of the LAWS in terms of correctly identifying targets is the OAM.'

  zh: PEM由两个组成部分组成：测试环境（TE）和输出准确性度量（OAM）。TE旨在模拟真实场景。例如，用于识别敌方火炮的LAWS可以在包含友军和敌军装备、试验假人及其他非敌方火炮物体的TE中进行测试。LAWS在正确识别目标方面的性能即为OAM。
- en: Additionally, a LAWS training in a TE must deploy to a similar environment when
    engaging in decision making. For instance, a LAWS completing PEM in a desert TE
    must be deployed in a desert environment upon completing PEM. Were the same LAWS
    to be deployed into a forested environment post-PEM, it may have diminished accuracy
    due to environmental deviations, requiring a reevaluation of performance.

  zh: 此外，在决策过程中，LAWS训练中的TE必须部署到类似的环境中。例如，完成PEM的沙漠TE中的LAWS必须在完成PEM后部署到沙漠环境中。如果同一台LAWS在PEM后部署到森林环境中，可能由于环境偏差而导致精度下降，需要重新评估其性能。

  zh: PEM期间的LAWS性能
- en: Consider a scenario in which the artillery identification LAWS undergoing PEM
    obtained an OAM of 99.9%; out of 1,000 objects, the system correctly identified
    999 as either enemy artillery or not enemy artillery. *Requiring LAWS to engage
    in a standardized PEM grants data scientists the ability to identify and determine
    a LAWS’s strengths and weaknesses in identification and determine how well a LAWS
    must perform before it is deployed.* In this scenario, the LAWS performs with
    an accuracy of 99.9%, but it confuses friendly artillery with enemy artillery
    .1% of the time. To what standards does the .1% confusion dictate successful completion
    of the PEM? Should the LAWS be deployed when it may commit fratricide? What if
    the same LAWS incorrectly identified enemy artillery as enemy tanks .1% of the
    time? Is that more acceptable? Perhaps this same LAWS’s accuracy outperforms that
    of humans. Is it acceptable to deploy?

  zh: 考虑这样一个场景，即正在进行PEM的火炮识别LAWS获得了99.9%的OAM；在1000个目标中，系统正确地将999个识别为敌方火炮或非敌方火炮。*要求LAWS参与标准化的PEM使数据科学家能够识别和确定LAWS在识别方面的优势和劣势，并确定LAWS在部署前必须表现得多好。*在这种情况下，LAWS的准确率为99.9%，但它有0.1%的时间将友方火炮误认为敌方火炮。0.1%的混淆水平是否指导了PEM的成功完成标准？当LAWS可能犯下友军误伤时，应该部署它吗？如果同一LAWS将敌方火炮错误地识别为敌方坦克0.1%的时间，那是否更可接受？也许这同一LAWS的准确率超过了人类。是否可以部署它？
- en: The answers to these questions coincide with current laws of warfare and the
    level of warfare countries are engaging in. In total war, for example, the PEM
    standards may be lower, as the potential collateral damage is outweighed by the
    lives lost by continuing warfare. In counterterrorism scenarios, perhaps the PEM
    OAM requirement and TE conditions are much higher or else LAWS are banned completely,
    because the risk of even a small inaccuracy could have far-reaching strategic
    impacts. The PEM is an approach that gives countries the opportunity to create
    policies to ensure LAWS are used as ethically as possible.

  zh: 这些问题的答案与当前的战争法律和国家参与的战争水平相一致。例如，在全面战争中，PEM的标准可能较低，因为潜在的附带损害被继续战争中失去的生命所超越。在反恐怖主义场景中，也许PEM的OAM要求和TE条件要高得多，否则LAWS将完全被禁止使用，因为即使微小的不准确性风险也可能产生深远的战略影响。PEM是一种方法，使各国有机会制定政策，以确保LAWS尽可能以道德方式使用。

  zh: PEM：持续和循环
- en: The PEM requires additional enforceable standards for implementation on an international
    scale. Additionally, the PEM determines only whether LAWS are initially deployable.
    LAWS must be monitored on a regular basis to ensure continued accuracy, or they
    can be “pulled off the line” and retested using PEM. LAWS that have undergone
    model retraining must also recertify under the PEM prior to deployment to ensure
    continued performance.

  zh: PEM要求在国际范围内实施额外的可执行标准。此外，PEM仅确定LAWS是否最初可部署。必须定期监控LAWS以确保持续准确性，否则它们可能会被“撤出生产线”，并使用PEM重新测试。已经进行模型重新训练的LAWS在部署之前也必须在PEM下重新认证，以确保持续性能。
