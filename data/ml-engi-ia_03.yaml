    development. Having a rough estimate can inform the discussion with the broader
    team about why one solution should be pursued over another. But should the ML
    team be deciding alone which implementation to use? Inherent bias will be present
    in any of the team’s assumptions, so to assuage these factors, it can be useful
    to create a weighted matrix report that the larger team (and the project leader)
    can use to choose an implementation.

  zh: 这些问题应该是实验阶段和开发阶段之间的审查阶段的一部分。有一个粗略的估计可以通知更广泛的团队关于为什么应该选择一个解决方案而不是另一个解决方案的讨论。但机器学习团队应该单独决定使用哪种实现吗？任何团队的假设都存在固有的偏见，因此为了减轻这些因素，创建一个加权矩阵报告可能是有用的，这个报告可以让更大的团队（以及项目负责人）用来选择一个实现。

    Remember that everyone else on the team is going to have to maintain this solution,

    draft a comparative analysis. It’s important to find someone familiar with gauging
    the cost and benefit of different approaches—someone who has enough experience
    to have lived through the difficult times of maintaining fragile approaches. I
    typically find someone who hasn’t been involved in the project up to this point
    in order to ensure that they have no bias about a decision. Their objective opinion,
    without bias, can help ensure that the data contained in the report is accurate
    so that the larger team can evaluate options honestly.
