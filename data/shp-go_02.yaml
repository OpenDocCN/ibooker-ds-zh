    for those who want to take the language they’ve learned and build something with
    it. You know how to write code, and you want to ship it. The concepts and processes
    taught here should be agnostic to the technology or language you use, but I provide
    concrete examples using Go and GitHub Actions. By using their terminology, you
    should be able to easily adapt what I write here to Python and GitLab or JavaScript

    to help with the quick creation of quality software. Some of these concepts predate
    the development of computers and the software development industry. Over the past
    few decades, software companies have looked to other industries to help them build
    products more efficiently to meet the demands of their customers. What they found
    were processes that created fast feedback from their customers. Based on that
    feedback, they were able to adapt their product. Adapting their products allowed

    when a customer asks for them just in time for development rather than by guessing
    the customer’s desires and spending time and money upfront developing something

    can be used by another person. Artifacts can be delivered privately and publicly.
    In some cases, a company will build what’s called a *release candidate*, which
    is a product that is almost ready to be given out to the general public. This
    candidate can be run through another set of automated tests to check for performance
    problems (load testing), usability problems (UI testing), or if it even works
    (smoke testing). The manual tests can be run to explore the product, get a stamp
    of approval, and be released to the public, as shown in figure 1.5.

    of their priority lists because they feel their product is too volatile at the
    beginning, but tests are more than just security blankets for developers. Instead,
    they tell developers about the business rules they are writing and steer the product
    toward their intended goal. These guard rails can help developers in the long
    term, and establishing them as basic validation in a pipeline helps accelerate
    the growth of a product and gives autonomy to developers by documenting the business
    expectations through code. We explore this process in chapter 3 by setting up
    a basic unit testing process.
