    to increase the team’s impact is that there is no single effective approach. A

    genuine care for your team member’s well-being and be sensitive to their potential
    fear of failure.

- en: To coach effectively, a coach must first actively listen to what the team member
    is saying and not saying, distinguish emotions through tone of voice and body
    language, and reflect back and summarize any observations. When in doubt, the
    coach can use open-ended questions to cultivate greater clarity in the situation.

    team member to identify SMART goals that are specific, measurable, attainable,
    relevant, and time bound, as well as to design new actions to attain the desired
    results. The team member is ultimately responsible for their own actions and results.

- en: For mentoring to work effectively, topics should expand beyond coaching for
    goals, focus, process, and strategy to include mastery of the capabilities and

- en: To be a great mentor, you should listen to your team member’s vision of their
    ideal self and accept it by consistently endorsing their vision. Often, their
    vision is beyond the scope of your team. Value the time you have with your ambitious
    team members, and do what you can to help engage them in projects aligned with
    their ideal self where possible. You will likely earn their trust and dedication,
    and help them produce their best work through the highs and lows of your projects.

    to generate viable choices. Rationales, personal experiences, and the principles
    behind your recommendations can make your advice more powerful and easier to remember

- en: To be a great advisor, you can always be looking to provide a deeper understanding
    of complex issues to help your team member make more informed decisions. The advice
    involves introducing them to previously unexamined alternatives and expanding
    their repertoire of action steps. Other than the specific decisions and actions,

    at the beginning of a project forces you to have a clear hypothesis to guide the
    progress toward more detailed iterations. In product, this can be a way to move
    a key success metric. In DS projects, this can be the cause of churn and ways
    to improve retention. The team can then have more opportunities to suggest disconfirming
    evidence and introduce additional ideas, intuitions, and perspectives to iteratively
    strengthen the weakly held opinion.

    bias, denying the antecedent, and base-rate fallacy, which are among 175 bias
    categories listed by Buster Benson [2]. By seeking disconfirming evidence, you
    can counter confirmation bias. In contrast, people tend to only look for evidence
    confirming their opinions, leading to confirmation bias. As you discover different
    perspectives in the process, you can overcome selection bias by selecting statistically
    significant results, rather than only positive anecdotal examples. You can also
    counter optimism bias by planning for the likely scenario, rather than the unrealistically
    optimistic best-case scenario.

    grand prize-winning solution of the famous million-dollar Netflix Prize challenge
    was never deployed. The winning solution was an overly-elaborate ensemble model.
    Per Netflix’s own technology blog [10], “the additional accuracy gains that we

    a production environment.”

    and keep the good person. Sharing how you feel, describing the broader impact,

    responsibility of the mistake and its impact on the organization. Reaffirming

    as the manager, should take responsibility for the mistake and clarify the goal.
    For steps one to four of the practice, the focus is on the mistake. Your ability
    to be specific about what went wrong will build trust by allowing the team member
    to feel that you are on top of things. Focusing on the bad behavior rather than
    the person reduces the chance that the team member will feel they are under attack,
    become defensive, and, ultimately, not learn from the mistake. Steps five to seven
    are focused on building confidence in team members and helping the team get better
    results. Reaffirming your trust in the team member can not only help them feel
    better, but it can also help put yourself in a more trusting mood when interacting
