- en: The past 10 years in machine-learning research have been deeply influenced by
    smart people turning their attention to the brain and the way it works. With capacious
    terrestrial computing and graphical processing units (GPUs) that optimize machine-learning
    code speed and deployment by orders of magnitude, both older models and newer
    approaches that are computationally difficult to empirically test are widely available,
    democratized by the cloud, not hidden and usable only by big web companies.

  zh: 过去十年中，机器学习研究深受聪明人将注意力转向大脑及其工作方式的影响。随着庞大的地面计算能力和图形处理单元（GPU）的出现，它们通过数倍优化机器学习代码的速度和部署，使得既有的模型和计算上难以实证测试的新方法都变得广泛可用，通过云服务民主化，不再被大型的网络公司所独占。
- en: As it turns out, modeling how to think, hear, see, and speak based on the brain,
    and taking those models and easily deploying them, sharing them, retraining and
    adapting them, and using them have yielded many advances, such as the intelligent
    digital assistant in your smartphone or a home assistant device that can order
    food or turn the channel to your favorite program based on your talking to it
    and its talking to you.

  zh: 结果表明，基于大脑如何思考、听、看和说话的建模，以及将这些模型轻松部署、共享、重新训练和适应，并使用它们，已经带来了许多进步，例如智能手机中的智能数字助手或可以基于你与它的对话来订购食物或切换到你最喜欢的节目的家庭助手设备。
- en: These machine-learning models are called neural networks. Neural networks are
    modeled based on your brain, which contains networks of connected neurons. The
    recent release of models like GPT-3 that automatically generate believable news
    articles, plays, tweets, and you name it feels like the beginning of the (r)evolution.

  zh: 这些机器学习模型被称为神经网络。神经网络是基于你的大脑建模的，它包含由连接的神经元组成的网络。最近发布的模型，如自动生成可信新闻文章、剧本、推文等，感觉就像是（r）革命的开始。
- en: TensorFlow is optimized for creating neural networks and getting them deployed
    and evaluated. This part of the book shows you how to create, train, and evaluate
    some of the neural networks most commonly used today to touch, see, speak, and
    hear.
