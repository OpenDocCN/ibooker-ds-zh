- en: Closed-loop systems that use data to fuel artificial intelligence have the ability
    to change the world. Such systems are already saving lives, allocating capital,
    executing contracts, and making increasing numbers of decisions on behalf of their
    human overlords. As an architect of the future, wielding this power to make the
    world a better rather than a lesser place demands respect and consideration. Much
    like privacy or security, ethics in these systems can’t be treated as an aside.
    It needs to be treated as an integral part of design right from inception through
    to execution and beyond.

  zh: 利用数据驱动人工智能的闭环系统有能力改变世界。这些系统已经在拯救生命、分配资本、执行合同，并代表其人类主人做出越来越多的决策。作为未来的设计师，行使这种权力以使世界变得更好而非更坏，需要尊重和考虑。就像隐私或安全性一样，这些系统中的伦理问题不能被视为一种附带。从概念到执行以及更远的未来，伦理必须作为设计的一个整体部分来对待。

    at which poor choices can lead to perverse outcomes: the before, the now, and

- en: During the *before* point, the firmament has yet to be built. Here, the biggest
    risk is unintentionally causing personal or social harm despite the best of intentions;
    algorithms are trained on data, and if that data reflects institutionalized disadvantage,
    the future will be forced to mirror the present.

  zh: 在**之前**的时刻，天穹尚未建立。在这里，尽管有最好的意图，最大的风险是无意中导致个人或社会的伤害；算法是基于数据训练的，如果这些数据反映出制度性劣势，未来将不得不反映现在。
- en: Consider a firm that’s interested in using AI to identify and accelerate high
    performers within its staff. To train its algorithms, it pulls HR data and trains
    a model to discriminate between people who succeed and those who don’t. However,
    by doing so it has unintentionally created a monster that runs the risk of institutionalizing
    sexism into the firm’s operating model.

  zh: 想象一个有意向使用AI识别和加速其员工中高绩效者的公司。为了训练其算法，它获取人力资源数据并训练模型来区分成功者和失败者。然而，通过这样做，它无意中创造了一个风险，将性别歧视制度化到公司的运营模式中。
- en: Let’s assume the firm isn’t sexist, nor is it operating with a deliberately
    sexist governance framework; how did we get here?

  zh: 让我们假设公司不是性别歧视的，也不是故意采用性别歧视的治理框架；我们是怎么到这里的呢？
- en: Even if the firm’s management team has always tried to promote based on merit,
    historically male-dominated research fields have created a generational bias toward
    hiring male graduates for decades. The data that the algorithm uses is fundamentally
    contaminated; even if the model doesn’t explicitly include gender as a predictor,
    gender is likely to be historically correlated with male behaviors such as a lower
    likelihood of taking parental leave.

  zh: 即使公司的管理团队一直试图基于功绩来提升，但历史上男性主导的研究领域已经导致几十年来招聘男性毕业生存在代际偏见。算法使用的数据从根本上是受到污染的；即使模型没有明确将性别作为预测因素，性别很可能与男性行为有历史上的相关性，如较少可能休产假。
- en: The perverse outcome is that an accurate model may have an inherent bias toward
    accelerating males, not because men are better candidates, but simply because
    they outnumber women and therefore have historically been more likely to have
    been promoted in absolute terms.

  zh: 逆向结果是，一个准确的模型可能存在向男性加速的固有偏见，这并不是因为男性是更好的候选人，而仅仅因为他们人数众多，因此在绝对术语上历史上更有可能得到晋升。
- en: In the before, you need to think about how your choices might unintentionally
    undermine the very problem you’re trying to solve. Even the best intentions can
    go unintentionally awry given the wrong data.

- en: Consider a bank interested in maximizing profits. Credit cards drive margins,
    but only if they’re used in a particular way. Spend too much and the customer
    can’t cover their debts, forcing a default and costing the bank money. Carry over
    too little and the bank is probably breaking even on card fees but making minimal
    profit. The ideal customer is a “revolver,” one who carries a debt from month
    to month and pays off the minimum balance, maximizing interest revenue for the
    bank.

  zh: 想象一家有意最大化利润的银行。信用卡带动利润，但只有在特定的使用方式下。消费过度会导致客户无法偿还债务，迫使银行出现违约，并造成损失。带余额不足，则银行可能只能收回卡费，利润微薄。理想的客户是“循环信用”客户，每月带有债务并支付最低余额，从而最大化银行的利息收入。
- en: With the right data, it’s trivial to build a model that identifies how best
    to encourage people to spend more. There are infinite ways to nudge behavior,
    including loyalty rewards, badges, and indiscriminate use of dark patterns. Doing
    so can have a material impact on the bank’s bottom line. However, what subset
    of people will end up trapped in a cycle of debt if the bank chooses to do so?

  zh: 有了正确的数据，轻而易举地就能建立一个模型，识别如何最好地鼓励人们增加消费。影响行为的方法多种多样，包括忠诚度奖励、徽章和无差别使用黑暗模式。这样做可以对银行的底线产生实质性影响。然而，如果银行选择这样做，哪些人最终会陷入债务循环？

- en: Consider a media company interested in tailoring content. Its algorithms excel
    at matching content to interest. Over time, though, these same algorithms create
    highly insulated echo chambers. Dopamine-driven information consumption drives
    entire cohorts to see only the content that agrees with their worldview. Views
    become polarized and increasingly extremist in the absence of countervailing viewpoints.
    What might have started as a relatively harmless method to increase viewer stickiness
    can easily end up as a hotbed for societal unrest, due almost entirely and yet
    unintentionally to the underlying algorithms.

  zh: 想象一家有意定制内容的媒体公司。其算法擅长将内容与兴趣匹配。然而，随着时间的推移，这些算法也会创建高度封闭的信息圈。多巴胺驱动的信息消费导致整个群体只看到与其世界观一致的内容。观点变得极端化，并在没有对立观点的情况下日益极端化。最初可能是增加观众黏性的相对无害方法很容易成为社会动荡的温床，这几乎完全是由于潜在的算法，尽管无意间如此。
- en: In the after, you need to actively keep an eye on things you’ve built to make
    sure you’re not creating a world you wouldn’t want to live in. Your algorithms
    are your children, and their actions are your responsibility.
