- en: As a former-attorney-turned-analytics-person, my view on ethics has changed.
    Instead of looking at ethics as something that is a compliance item, I look at
    it as a strategy and a competitive differentiator. High data and analytics ethics
    can truly be a competitive advantage for organizations. Of course, this higher
    ethics threshold must be genuine and align with an organization’s culture, but
    if it does, and the organization takes up this higher ethical bar, then there
    are a variety of benefits it may be able to reap.

  zh: 作为一名前律师转型为分析人员，我的伦理观点发生了变化。我不再将伦理视为一项遵从性事项，而是视为战略和竞争差异化因素。高数据和分析伦理可以真正成为组织的竞争优势。当然，这种更高的伦理门槛必须是真诚的，并与组织的文化保持一致，但如果是这样，并且组织接受了这种更高的伦理标准，那么它可能会收获多种好处。
- en: First, in the war for talent, ethics can be a competitive advantage in hiring.
    Companies like Google and Microsoft have recently faced ethical pushback from
    their employees and received bad press over work the companies undertook.

  zh: 首先，在人才争夺战中，伦理可以成为招聘的竞争优势。像谷歌和微软这样的公司最近面临员工的伦理抵制，并因公司进行的工作而受到负面报道。
- en: Second, customers and partners are looking for companies to be more transparent
    and ethical in how they harness data. Customers are tired of reading the fine
    print. They are tired of the bait and switch. They are tired of companies asking
    for forgiveness, not asking for permission. Organizations that recognize this
    and raise their data and analytics ethical bar will be able to differentiate themselves
    from their competitors and, at the same time, may be able to be more resourceful
    and analytics-focused and thus save costs.

  zh: 其次，顾客和合作伙伴希望公司在如何利用数据方面更透明和更有伦理。顾客厌倦了阅读那些细则条款。他们厌倦了鱼目混珠。他们厌倦了公司只求原谅，而不是征得许可。那些意识到这一点并提高其数据和分析伦理标准的组织将能够区别于竞争对手，同时可能更加资源丰富和专注于分析，从而节省成本。
- en: Third, brands will be increasingly impacted by the ethics of how they use data.
    A brand that has shown a propensity for high analytics ethics should likely have
    higher brand affinity. Further, when mistakes arise, there will be an audience
    more forgiving of the brand.

  zh: 第三，品牌将越来越受到其数据使用伦理的影响。一个展示了高分析伦理倾向的品牌可能会有更高的品牌亲和力。此外，当出现错误时，会有更多观众对品牌宽容。
- en: Recently, I have been thinking more about the importance around ethics and analytics
    with Dr. Bonnie Holub and in connection with my interviews of chief data officers
    and chief analytics officers in preparation for our upcoming book. Having higher
    ethical standards can’t just happen in a day and on a whim. Instead, there must
    be a change that occurs from the top down and from the bottom up in both support
    and recognition. This includes aligning these ethical standards with the authentic
    culture of the organization. There may be a desire to modify an organization’s
    culture from both the top down and the bottom up, but recognition of this need
    and a plan to conduct this change are essential to make it effective.

  zh: 最近，我开始更多地思考与伦理和分析的重要性，与邦妮·霍卢布博士以及在为我们即将出版的书籍做准备时与首席数据官和首席分析官的采访中联系起来。拥有更高的伦理标准不可能一蹴而就，也不可能凭空出现。相反，这必须是从上到下和从下到上发生变化，并得到支持和认可。这包括将这些伦理标准与组织的真实文化对齐。从上到下和从下到上都可能希望修改组织的文化，但认识到这种需求并制定变革计划是使其有效的关键。
- en: One thing organizations may seek to do is to establish their Data Principles.
    Basically, think of Data Principles as your organization’s bylaws or manifesto
    on how it uses data and analytics. Data Principles should include the ethical
    framework your organization seeks to have around harnessing data. The concept
    is taken in part from Ray Dalio’s book *Principles* (Simon & Schuster), in which
    he explains the personal and professional principles to which he partly attributes
    his success. Assuming your organization has high ethics in analytics as an agreed
    part of its strategy, incorporating high ethics explicitly in your Data Principles
    is important. Of course, those principles need to be well communicated and need
    to encourage holding truth up to power. These Data Principles should not be developed
    in a vacuum but instead should have broad input, buy-in, and communication.

  zh: 一个组织可能想要做的一件事是建立他们的数据原则。基本上，把数据原则看作是你组织的章程或者关于如何使用数据和分析的宣言。数据原则应包括你的组织希望在利用数据方面建立的道德框架。这个概念在某种程度上来源于雷·达里奥的书《原则》（Simon
    & Schuster），他在书中解释了一些个人和专业原则，他认为这些原则在一定程度上促成了他的成功。假设你的组织将高道德标准视为其战略的一部分，明确地将高道德标准纳入你的数据原则是很重要的。当然，这些原则需要被良好传达，并且需要鼓励揭示真相的权力。这些数据原则不应在真空中制定，而应该有广泛的输入、认同和沟通。
- en: Even with Data Principles in place, an organization has to ensure that people,
    process, and procedures are aligned to empower everyone to support a high level
    of ethics. The most important part of this is ensuring that everyone realizes
    ethics is their responsibility and is not left to compliance, attorneys, and others.
    Incorporating both empowerment and broad engagement around ethics and its importance
    can allow you to truly differentiate your organization based on ethics.

  zh: 即使有了数据原则，组织也必须确保人员、流程和程序的一致性，以赋予每个人支持高道德水平的能力。其中最重要的部分是确保每个人意识到道德是他们的责任，而不是留给合规、律师和其他人员处理。围绕道德和其重要性进行授权和广泛参与，可以让你的组织真正基于道德区别于他人。
