- en: Many technology executives and engineers talk about Cloud as a new destination.
    In reality it's a new state of mind. Cloud is best defined as a set of modern
    patterns and practices that abstract away the underlying infrastructure. On top
    of a new technology stack lies the evolution of new architectures for distributed
    systems that allow scale without requiring the developer to manage the underlying
    infrastructure and its design. This greatly lowers the barrier to building highly
    scalable, secure and distributed applications.

- en: At the turn of the 20th century business growth was slow, taking on average
    90 years to reach 1 billion dollars (US) in annual revenues (see [https://www.inc.com/laura-montini/infographic/how-long-it-takes-to-get-to-a-1-billion-valuation.xhtml](https://www.inc.com/laura-montini/infographic/how-long-it-takes-to-get-to-a-1-billion-valuation.xhtml)).
    This allowed companies who were first or early to their markets to effectively
    monopolize their industry. Innovation in manufacturing reduced this average to
    about 25 years in the years following World War II. Fast forward to the late 1990s
    and things really started heating up as companies leveraged technology to accelerate
    their business models. Most of the acceleration was in companies with no physical
    presence (true web companies), most full-stack companies failed in this era with
    the exception of a few shining stars like Google, Amazon and Netflix. Today, innovations
    in software development and infrastructure operations have led to an extraordinary
    amount of acceleration. These advances in digital velocity have disrupted entire
    markets in a relatively short amount of time. Think of what Netflix did for streaming,
    Amazon for retail, AirBnB for short term rentals and Uber for taxis.

  zh: A.3 应用程序开发和交付的传统模式
- en: Historically, enterprise applications were most often written using monolithic
    software development patterns. To help deal with monoliths at scale many developers
    moved from functional programming in languages like COBOL to Object Oriented Programming
    (OOP) in modern languages like C++ or Java and leveraged modular design patterns.
    This allowed developers to break up code bases into libraries that could be shared
    and re-used across entire application portfolios. For example, Other attempts
    at efficiency involved using stored procedures in relational databases to process
    data more rapidly. These innovations helped reduce toil, but they only rarely
    allowed enterprises to scale innovative ideas across more than a few teams. Instead,
    enterprises more often became quagmire in dealing with the legacy problems introduced
    by these new development paradigms.

  zh: 从历史上看，企业应用程序最常使用单体软件开发模式。为了帮助处理规模化的单体，许多开发者从COBOL等语言中的函数式编程转向现代语言如C++或Java中的面向对象编程（OOP），并利用模块化设计模式。这使得开发者可以将代码库分解成库，这些库可以在整个应用程序组合中共享和重用。例如，其他提高效率的尝试包括在关系数据库中使用存储过程来更快地处理数据。这些创新有助于减少劳动强度，但它们很少允许企业将创新思想扩展到超过几个团队。相反，企业更常陷入处理由这些新开发范式引入的遗留问题。
- en: When the IT industry began, code would be written and remain relatively static
    for months or even years. Most businesses did not invest in rewriting or re-platforming
    code. As these new OOP-based applications grew organically, supporting them became
    increasingly complex. Today, these messy areas of the solution or “hacks” as they
    are popularly called are formally referred to as technical debt. Technical debt
    is recognized as a first class factor that can be used to gauge the Digital Velocity
    of an organization or specific project. Too much technical debt results in a reduced
    velocity over time whereas not enough means you're not moving fast enough in most
    cases to keep up with business needs.

    Processes were manual and error-prone. Developers, Operations teams, and managers
    all on a late-night conference call to deploy and debug an application were not
    uncommon. To help address this, [Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery

    and packaging deployment artifacts for release at any point in time. The goal
    of CI/CD is to create a reliable build and packaging process for repeatable success.
    Even with a powerful framework like CI/CD, realizing its efficiencies was difficult
    because the frameworks used to develop software were designed for applications
    that were designed for months or years and ran largely unchanged for long periods

    the Facebook team was performing 50,000 builds a day just for its Android app.
    The statistics we just mentioned only refer to their CI process which is responsible
    for building the source code and running local testing to validate the build.
    It doesn’t include the CD workflows, which would have massive infrastructure requirements
    to deploy 50,000 versions of the application on physical or virtual devices and
    run additional testing.

- en: These infrastructure challenges aren’t unique to Facebook. Years earlier, Google
    and Amazon ran into similar challenges building and operating their core infrastructure
    and applications. These challenges directly led to the cloud as we know it today.
    The invention of cloud platforms were largely driven by internal IT groups inability
    to respond to business needs on an acceptable timeline.Shadow IT as it is commonly
    known is the practice of leveraging a 3rd party IT provider to deliver the business
    needs outside of internal IT groups. A lot of early cloud customers have started
    in a shadow IT mode before fully adopting new cloud platforms as a standard for
    infrastructure and application delivery. In 2006 when Amazon launched Amazon Elastic
    Compute Cloud (EC2). Heroku (2007), GCP (2008), Azure (2010) and Cloud Foundry
    (2011) rapidly followed EC2\. Both Heroku and Cloud Foundry were cloud-based Platform
    as a Service (PaaS) solutions that focused on the idea of building [12 Factor
    Apps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelve-Factor_App_methodology). Although all
    of these cloud based platforms were great at creating incremental improvements,
    enterprise customers struggled to create complete transformation. The public cloud
    needed more maturity and the early PaaS platforms like [Google App Engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_App_Engine)
    were narrow in scope, having limited support for languages and advanced language
    capabilities.

  zh: 这些基础设施挑战并不仅限于Facebook。多年前，谷歌和亚马逊在构建和运营其核心基础设施和应用程序时遇到了类似的挑战。这些挑战直接导致了我们今天所知道的云。云平台的出现很大程度上是由内部IT团队无法在可接受的时程内响应业务需求所驱动的。影子IT，如通常所知，是利用第三方IT提供商来满足业务需求，而无需内部IT团队。许多早期的云客户在完全采用新的云平台作为基础设施和应用程序交付的标准之前，都是从影子IT模式开始的。2006年，当亚马逊推出Amazon
    Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)时，Heroku（2007年）、GCP（2008年）、Azure（2010年）和Cloud Foundry（2011年）迅速跟进EC2。Heroku和Cloud
    Foundry都是基于云的平台即服务（PaaS）解决方案，专注于构建[12因子应用程序](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelve-Factor_App_methodology)的理念。尽管所有这些基于云的平台在创造渐进式改进方面都很出色，但企业客户在创造全面转型方面却遇到了困难。公共云需要更多的成熟度，而早期的PaaS平台如[Google
    App Engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_App_Engine)范围较窄，对语言和高级语言功能的支持有限。

    start of an era that would disrupt the data center and a number of business markets.
    It was the first time in history that you didn’t need to build the software, acquire

    had to rent the infrastructure from the cloud or PaaS provider, build and deploy

- en: Around 2005 architects and developers started talking about the idea of [Test
    Driven Development (TDD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development).
    It was said that by following the principles of TDD your code would be more testable
    and ultimately more reliable. The concept of TDD is to think through a coding
    problem and write the testing plan and actual tests prior to writing the code
    itself. Many developers found success in this practice which has evolved into
    the concept of [Design by contract](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_by_contract).
    If you’re writing a web service exposing an API then you should define the contract
    and data model first. This forces developers to think through the input/output
    boundaries and build a well encapsulated service. It also gives the consumer teams
    of your API a contract to start using in their own development process. Design
    by contract leverages several of the concepts from SOA. With SOA, developers build
    all of the subsystems using a web service pattern with messaging protocols between
    services. As newer ideas were applied to this concept, new technologies began
    to emerge.

- en: Automated testing is much easier with these cloud native design patterns, we
    are able to create ephemeral environments dedicated to testing a specific component
    or feature, before releasing our software into an integrated environment for end
    to end testing. In the past most teams struggled to write automated tests that
    would accurately validate their software and not require a lot of change between
    deployments. The [test pyramid](https://martinfowler.com/articles/practical-test-pyramid.xhtml#TheTestPyramid)
    is a metaphor that tells us to group tests into buckets of different granularity
    (UI tests, service tests, unit tests). Most monolithic application development
    teams focused on building UI tests to validate the application. Since the UI group
    is known to require more integration this meant that these tests generally had
    to be updated regularly. This kept them from achieving advanced patterns like
    [canary](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/CanaryRelease.xhtml) or [blue/green](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/BlueGreenDeployment.xhtml)
    deployments. A canary is where we would slowly roll out the tested software to
    a small subset of users to collect live feedback before rolling out to all users.
    Whereas a blue/green allows us to maintain two copies; a green or production environment
    and a blue or staging environment allowing us to rollback to a previous state
    quickly if anything goes wrong.Since most of these apps are built from scratch,
    the teams are able to properly apply the test pyramid, as well as advanced end-to-end
    deployment patterns like a canary or blue/green deployment. This leads to complete
    autonomous deployments and unmatched development velocity. Another big challenge
    for monolithic teams was data rehydration; the ability to seed the software platform
    with the data required for automated testing. The challenge of data rehydration
    is no longer an issue as these teams generally build up their required data sets
    as part of their automated testing code bases. Allowing them to meet the unique
    requirements for each use case in the test plan and avoid compliance problems
    created by copying live data to test systems.

    是一个隐喻，告诉我们将测试分组到不同粒度的桶中（UI 测试、服务测试、单元测试）。大多数单体应用开发团队专注于构建 UI 测试来验证应用程序。由于 UI 组通常需要更多的集成，这意味着这些测试通常需要定期更新。这使他们无法实现像
    [金丝雀](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/CanaryRelease.xhtml) 或 [蓝/绿](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/BlueGreenDeployment.xhtml)
