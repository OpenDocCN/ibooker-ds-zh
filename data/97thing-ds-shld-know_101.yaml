- en: 'Marketing had once more delivered hyperpersonalized offerings. These offers
    were not only unique to each individual customer, but also context-sensitive to
    the specific mindset of each customer at the time that they were delivered. Upon
    receipt of each offer, every customer had the identical reaction: “I’ll take it.”'

  zh: 营销再次提供了超个性化的优惠。这些优惠不仅对每位顾客独特，而且还能根据每位顾客在接收时的具体心态进行上下文敏感性的调整。每位顾客收到优惠时的反应完全一致：“我要！”
- en: Merchandising had the perfect amount of inventory on hand in every store and
    in the fulfillment center. So regardless of where the customer wanted to complete
    the transaction, the product was in stock. Additional shipping costs to fulfill
    out-of-stock items were a thing of the past.

  zh: 商品管理在每家店铺和履行中心都拥有了完美数量的库存。因此，无论顾客想在哪里完成交易，产品都有库存。为了履行缺货商品而产生的额外运输成本已经成为过去。
- en: Excess inventory, clearance, and returns were nonexistent. IT removed the clearance
    section from the website, and store operations eliminated labor hours for redlining
    and returns. Every transaction was productive, and operational costs had never
    been lower.

  zh: 库存过剩、清仓和退货已经不存在。IT 移除了网站上的清仓部分，店铺运营也取消了处理退货和红线标记的工时。每一笔交易都是高效的，运营成本前所未有地降低。
- en: Financial planning and analysis continued its record of perfect forecast accuracy,
    as it nailed unit, margin, and revenue targets precisely. Stock prices soared,
    and incentive compensation targets were exceeded.

- en: The chief analytics officer took pride in the amount of customer data gathered
    and stored from transactions, loyalty, and social media...as well as the new video
    analytics capability that used facial recognition to track visits, dwell time,
    and sentiment for customers in the store. This information fed advanced machine
    learning models that could accurately predict what each customer would buy, at
    what price, through which channel, and when. It was astonishingly accurate.

  zh: 首席分析官以从交易、忠诚度和社交媒体中收集和存储的客户数据量为豪，以及利用面部识别追踪店内顾客的访问、停留时间和情感的新视频分析能力。这些信息为先进的机器学习模型提供了数据，能够精确预测每位顾客会以什么价格、通过哪个渠道和何时购买。这些预测惊人地准确。
- en: The repeated chaos of Monday mornings was a thing of the past. Leaders spent
    time creatively developing plans for future seasons instead of digging for the
    root cause of sales missing expectations. Pricing was competitive, aggressive,
    and perfect—beating the competition and delivering profitable margins.

- en: The first customer was thrilled. “They know me—sometimes better than I know
    myself,” she said. “Everything that they offer me works. It is always at a price
    that I think is fair, and they always have my size in stock. The colors and looks
    fit perfectly with my existing wardrobe and my style. In fact, I had just recently
    posted a comment that I needed new boots when they showed me the perfect pair!”
    She even shouted, “*It’s utopia!*”

  zh: 第一位顾客感到非常满意。“他们了解我——有时比我自己还了解，”她说。“他们提供给我的每一样东西都很有效。价格总是我认为公道的，并且他们总是有我的尺码库存。颜色和款式完美地符合我的现有衣橱和风格。事实上，我刚刚在评论中提到需要新靴子时，他们就给我展示了完美的一双！”她甚至喊道，“*这简直是乌托邦！*”
- en: The second customer was furious and skeptical. “I don’t like how much of my
    information they track. With every purchase, I need to provide my email address
    or phone number. Even when I’m browsing the website, they track me. It even seems
    like they track my social media activity and conversations—how else would they
    know what I discussed with my spouse last night and send me an offer on it today?
    And who knows what they’re doing with all of my information or who they are selling
    it to!” She griped, “*It’s dystopia!*”

  zh: 第二位顾客感到愤怒和怀疑。“我不喜欢他们追踪我的信息有多么频繁。每次购买都需要提供我的电子邮件地址或电话号码。即使我在网站上浏览，他们也在追踪我。甚至看起来他们追踪我的社交媒体活动和对话——不然他们怎么知道我昨晚和我配偶讨论的内容，并且今天给我发送相关优惠？而且谁知道他们对我的信息做了什么，或者他们将其出售给了谁！”她抱怨说：“*这简直是个反乌托邦！*”

    depends on whom you asked.

- en: The rise of technical capabilities to gather, track, and analyze demographic,
    transactional, and behavioral customer data raises the bar on retailer performance
    expectations. It is no longer acceptable for a retailer to market a product that
    doesn’t perfectly resonate with the customer—at the right size, price, and style.
    And if performance expectations rise, only the best retailers will survive, and
    the level of service and quality that customers experience will also rise.

  zh: 技术能力的提升使得收集、追踪和分析人口统计、交易和行为客户数据的门槛提高了。零售商不再可以市场上推广不完全符合顾客需求的产品——无论是尺寸、价格还是风格。如果期望值提升，只有最优秀的零售商才能生存下去，并且顾客体验的服务和质量水平也会提高。
- en: Should retailers be required to gain approval from every customer in order to
    use their information? Doing so would surely increase costs and create significant
    inefficiencies in the timeliness and effectiveness of their analytical models
    at minimum and would also likely reduce the accuracy of those models. And if that
    happens, perhaps both retailers and customers lose.

  zh: 应该要求零售商必须得到每位顾客的批准才能使用他们的信息吗？这样做肯定会增加成本，并在最低限度上在时效性和分析模型的效果上造成显著的低效，而且还可能降低这些模型的准确性。如果这样的话，也许零售商和顾客都会失去。

- en: Instead of a scenario resembling a dystopia with great suffering or injustice,
    customers would experience a more ideal state of fewer offers, more relevance,
    and better products, service, and quality. While 100% conversion ultimately is
    not practical or achievable, striving for this goal may yield the closest semblance
    of a perfect, utopian experience both for the customer and the retailer.

  zh: 与其经历类似反乌托邦般的痛苦和不公正的场景，顾客将体验到更为理想的状态：少些优惠，更多相关性，以及更好的产品、服务和质量。虽然完全实现100%的转化最终可能不切实际，但为了这个目标而努力，可能会实现顾客和零售商都追求的接近完美的乌托邦体验。
