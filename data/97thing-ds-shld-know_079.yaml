- en: With the spotlight on data privacy and ethics concerns in the wake of regulations
    like the European Union’s GDPR, data breaches at high-profile companies, illegal
    use of data, and more, all organizations will need to examine the ethics of their
    own approaches to data collection, analysis, and monetization. The power and scope
    that our data collection capability now offers is increasingly introducing a multitude
    of ethics questions on a wide range of applications that have never needed to
    be addressed in the past.

  zh: 在像欧盟GDPR这样的法规、高调公司的数据泄露、数据的非法使用等问题引发的数据隐私和伦理关注的聚光灯下，所有组织都需要审视其数据收集、分析和货币化方法的伦理问题。我们现在数据收集能力所提供的权力和范围正在日益引入多种从未在过去需要解决的伦理问题，涉及广泛的应用。
- en: One consequence of this heightened awareness of data ethics may be the impact
    of negative publicity on an organization’s ability to recruit in a very tight
    labor market. It’s important that senior level analytics leaders be aware of how
    ethical dilemmas in data science can impact their organization’s appeal to potential
    talent. Data scientists have an increasing number of career options, and as the
    data movement continues to mature, we’re seeing many data scientists making career
    decisions based on what a firm does, or its “mission.” In many cases, data scientists
    are even willing to trade off higher salaries in favor of “mission-driven” roles.
    Not only can high-profile ethics snafus and controversies create a public relations
    crisis, but they can also impede a firm’s ability to attract top-tier talent,
    who may think twice about joining a firm with a business model that does not match
    their values.

  zh: 数据伦理意识的提高可能带来的一个后果是负面宣传对组织在竞争激烈的劳动市场中招聘能力的影响。高级别分析领导者了解数据科学中的伦理困境如何影响其组织吸引潜在人才的能力至关重要。数据科学家有越来越多的职业选择，随着数据运动的成熟，我们看到许多数据科学家根据公司的所做之事或其“使命”做出职业决策。在许多情况下，数据科学家甚至愿意放弃更高的薪水，选择“使命驱动”的角色。高调的伦理失误和争议不仅可能造成公关危机，而且还可能阻碍公司吸引顶尖人才，这些人才可能会因为公司的商业模式与其价值观不符而三思而后加入。
- en: The organization’s position on data-related ethics and privacy should be reflected
    in the attitudes and behaviors of analytics staff, as well as being one of the
    criteria used to evaluate new additions to the quantitative team. Data scientists
    and analytics professionals are naturally screened based on their skills and tool
    proficiencies. Identifying professionals who are also a strong cultural fit is
    dependent on many factors, and going forward one of these factors should be whether
    or not a candidate’s attitudes toward ethical and privacy concerns match those
    of the organization.

  zh: 组织在数据相关的伦理和隐私问题上的立场应该反映在分析人员的态度和行为中，同时也应作为评估定量团队新成员的标准之一。数据科学家和分析专业人员通常根据其技能和工具熟练程度进行筛选。确定是否与组织的伦理和隐私关注态度相符的专业人士取决于许多因素，未来一个重要因素之一应该是候选人对伦理和隐私问题的态度。
- en: 'Given the importance and complexity of these issues, I ask the question: is
    a dedicated ethics lead required to drive the conversation around these increasingly
    prevalent ethical quandaries on data science teams? This could be a leader specifically
    responsible for developing the organizational roadmap and guardrails when it comes
    to how ethics and privacy guidelines are observed by the organization. Similar
    to data governance, which is concerned with who has access to which information,
    and data protection, as well as other related functions, the role of an ethics
    lead would be to gather consensus to develop ethical guidelines and ensure organizational
    compliance.'

  zh: 鉴于这些问题的重要性和复杂性，我提出一个问题：数据科学团队是否需要一个专门负责推动围绕这些日益普遍的伦理难题展开讨论的伦理主管？这个领导者可能是专门负责制定组织路线图和保护措施，以确保组织遵守伦理和隐私指南。类似于数据治理关注谁可以访问哪些信息，以及数据保护等其他相关功能，伦理主管的角色将是汇集共识，制定伦理指南，并确保组织遵守相关法规。
- en: A few short years ago, data scientist “unicorns” were expected to have the skills
    to tackle everything from data acquisition to cleaning, modeling, and evangelism,
    and with the rapid maturation of the discipline, we’re now seeing other roles
    splinter off to tackle different aspects of this process. By now everybody’s heard
    about data engineering, and roles like the data storyteller are also on the rise—will
    data ethics roles be the next big wave for data science talent?

  zh: 几年前，数据科学家的“独角兽”们被期望具备从数据获取到清洗、建模和传播等各方面的技能，随着这一学科的迅速成熟，我们现在看到其他角色开始分离，专注于处理这一过程的不同方面。到目前为止，每个人都听说过数据工程，而像数据故事讲述者这样的角色也在崛起——数据伦理角色会是下一个数据科学人才的大浪潮吗？
- en: Organizations have a responsibility to consider how their data is being used
    and monetized, and if analytics leaders do not take a proactive approach to establishing
    their team’s values on privacy and ethics dilemmas, or if the firm does not appoint
    someone to manage this task, it may leave the organization vulnerable. We’ve seen
    ethics roles scattered among some organizations in industries like financial services
    and health care, where customer or patient privacy regulations are paramount,
    but as more industries expand their use of data, it may be prudent for all companies
    to prioritize this type of role.

  zh: 组织有责任考虑他们的数据如何被使用和货币化，如果分析领导者不采取积极的方法来确立团队在隐私和伦理困境上的价值观，或者如果公司不指派人员来管理这项任务，可能会使组织变得脆弱。我们已经看到在一些行业的组织中散布着伦理角色，如金融服务和医疗保健行业，在这些行业中，客户或患者隐私规定至关重要，但随着更多行业扩展其数据使用，对所有公司来说优先考虑这种角色可能是明智的。
