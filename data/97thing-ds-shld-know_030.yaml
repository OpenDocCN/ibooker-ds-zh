- en: Over the past decade, we have witnessed an eruption of individual data being
    collected and made available for use in the cybersphere. This, coupled with extensive
    options for burst computing capability, has resulted in analytic algorithms with
    a voracious appetite for data that may provide unique insights about individuals
    and/or populations. Seeing data as a playground for data scientists to explore
    has significant upside, but with it comes a dark underbelly. Of greatest concern
    is the irresponsible use of very private data to feed algorithms, which can result
    in unintended consequences, embarrassing public relation challenges, or runaway
    AI/ML algorithms that can integrate biases.

  zh: 在过去的十年中，我们见证了个人数据在网络空间被收集并提供以供使用的激增。这与爆发式计算能力的广泛选择结合，导致了对可能提供有关个人和/或人群独特见解的分析算法的狂热需求。将数据视为数据科学家探索的游乐场具有显著的优势，但随之而来的是其黑暗面。最大的关注点是不负责任地使用非常私密的数据来供养算法，这可能导致意想不到的后果，尴尬的公共关系挑战，或者能够整合偏见的AI/ML算法失控。
- en: You may be familiar with the Lemming Effect. It is based on the unsubstantiated
    tendency of these small rodents to mindlessly kill themselves by jumping off of
    cliffs, one after the other. It has come to represent unquestioningly following
    others without consideration of the consequences. So how does the use of expanded
    personal data equate to the Lemming Effect?

  zh: 您可能熟悉雷明效应。它基于这些小型啮齿类动物无端地倾向于毫无思考地相继跳下悬崖自杀。它已经成为毫无考虑地跟随他人行事的象征。那么，扩展个人数据的使用如何等同于雷明效应呢？
- en: It seems that if one organization is using all the data at its disposal, this
    behavior acts like an aphrodisiac to other organizations, who feel compelled to
    do the same thing. They may do this with little or no regard for the consequences.
    Fear of falling behind and not applying the most advanced analytic techniques
    to every bit of available data propels analytic teams and companies to unwittingly
    accept another organization’s data ethics (or lack thereof) as the de facto code
    of conduct. They simply “jump off the cliff” because another organization has
    done the same thing. However, there are alternatives.

  zh: 如果一个组织利用其处置的所有数据，这种行为就像对其他组织的春药一样，迫使它们感觉必须做同样的事情。他们可能会在很少或根本没有考虑后果的情况下这样做。害怕落后并且不将最先进的分析技术应用于所有可用数据的每一位推动分析团队和公司不知不觉地接受另一个组织的数据伦理（或其缺乏）作为实际行为准则。他们简单地“跳下悬崖”，因为另一个组织已经这样做了。然而，还有其他选择。
- en: In the development of algorithms, there can be a delicate balance between the
    ever-increasing demand for individual-specific data and the value that data brings
    to that algorithm. Certainly, adding more data has the potential to increase lift
    in the predictive capability of a model, but at what cost? That cost can be one
    of dollars and cents attached to acquiring the data, but more importantly, it
    should be considered in terms of ethical impact and the stewardship responsibilities
    associated with the data entrusted to a company’s care.

  zh: 在算法开发中，个体特定数据的需求与数据为该算法带来的价值之间可能存在微妙的平衡。当然，添加更多数据有潜力提高模型预测能力的提升，但代价是什么？这种成本可能是与获取数据相关的资金和分钱，但更重要的是，应该考虑其在伦理影响和托管公司所信任数据的责任方面的影响。
- en: Categorical data, or data connected to an individual by an association such
    as street address, is generally less troublesome than individual data that is
    specific to that person. Models that use categorical data can be almost as effective
    as those using individual data, depending on the application. That makes categorical
    data an ideal choice if the individual data needed for a model is considered sensitive.
    It takes effort to compare output using each of these types of data. However,
    in doing so the final choice of a model can be focused not just on the variation
    between the two types of data but also on the ethical concerns of routinely using
    sensitive personal data.

  zh: 分类数据，或者与个体相关联的数据，如街道地址，通常比那些具体特定于个人的个体数据问题要少。使用分类数据的模型在某些应用中几乎可以与使用个体数据的模型一样有效。这使得分类数据成为一个理想选择，如果用于模型的个体数据被视为敏感的话。比较使用每种数据类型输出的工作需要一些努力。然而，通过这样做，模型的最终选择不仅可以集中于这两种数据类型之间的变化，还可以考虑到常规使用敏感个人数据所涉及的伦理问题。
- en: When considering socioeconomic data that can provide insights into a person’s
    health care needs, publicly available data can provide more than enough veracity
    for a model to be effective. This isn’t to say individual data would not improve
    the model. For example, when considering the housing vulnerability of a person
    for health or social needs, knowing how many individual addresses a person has
    had over a 12-month period, their past evictions and/or foreclosures, or the housing
    situation of their relatives can certainly better inform a model. However, data
    input such as current address, and the characteristics of that community/census
    block/etc.—from income to availability of fresh food and type of housing—can be
    as effective in guiding a care navigator in their decisions.

  zh: 在考虑能够为个人健康护理需求提供见解的社会经济数据时，公开可获取的数据完全可以为模型的有效性提供足够的真实性。这并不是说个体数据不能改善模型。例如，在考虑一个人的住房脆弱性时，了解一个人在12个月内拥有多少个地址，他们过去的驱逐或者房屋被收回情况，或者他们亲属的住房情况，无疑能更好地为模型提供信息。然而，像当前地址及其社区/普查区等特征——从收入到新鲜食物的可获得性和住房类型——的数据输入，可以有效地指导护理导航者做出决策。
- en: All of this isn’t intended to disqualify the use of individual data for models.
    But data stewardship is a critical responsibility, especially when collecting
    data specific to an individual. The bottom line is that every organization should
    consider minimizing its sensitive data footprint. Starting with a data code of
    ethics and establishing rules around what risks an organization is willing to
    accept will at the very least take this important decision out of the hands of
    an individual analyst or data scientist and put it back in the hands of the enterprise,
    where it belongs. Using data for the collective good of others and not for individual
    gain or profit may seem like an altruistic or perhaps even naive goal, but it
    is one that should be considered as part of the stewardship responsibility organizations
    have when contemplating the use of personally identifiable data embedded into
    a business process.

  zh: 所有这些并不意味着要淘汰单个数据在模型中的使用。但数据管理是一项关键责任，特别是在收集特定个人数据时。关键在于，每个组织都应考虑将其敏感数据足迹最小化。从数据伦理准则开始，并建立起组织愿意接受哪些风险的规则，至少可以将这一重要决定从个体分析师或数据科学家手中收回，并交还给企业，这是其应有的位置。使用数据造福他人而非个人利益或利润可能看起来是一种利他主义，甚至是天真的目标，但在考虑将个人可识别数据嵌入业务流程时，这是组织在管理责任上应当考虑的一部分。
