- en: 'What do the following things all have in common: marketing attribution analysis,
    anti-money laundering (AML) analysis, customer journey modeling, safety incident
    causal factor analysis, literature-based discovery, fraud network detection, internet
    search node analysis, map application creation, disease cluster analysis, and
    analyzing the performance of a William Shakespeare play. As you might have guessed,
    what these all have in common is the use of graphs, proving that Shakespeare was
    right when he declared, “All the world’s a graph!”'

  zh: 下列事物有什么共同点：营销归因分析、反洗钱（AML）分析、客户旅程建模、安全事故因果分析、基于文献的发现、欺诈网络检测、互联网搜索节点分析、地图应用创建、疾病集群分析以及分析威廉·莎士比亚剧作表演的表现。你可能已经猜到，它们的共同点是使用图表，证明了莎士比亚在他宣称“全世界都是图”时是正确的！
- en: Okay, the Bard of Avon did not actually write *graph* in that sentence, he wrote
    *stage*. However, notice that the examples listed above all involve entities and
    the relationships between them, including both direct and indirect (transitive)
    relationships. Entities are the nodes in the graph—these can be people, events,
    objects, concepts, or places. The relationships between the nodes are the edges
    in the graph. Therefore, isn’t the very essence of a Shakespearean play the active
    portrayal of entities (the nodes) and their relationships (the edges)? Consequently,
    maybe Shakespeare could have written *graph* in his famous declaration.

  zh: 好吧，阿文的诗人实际上并没有在那个句子中写*图*，他写了*舞台*。然而，请注意，上述列出的例子都涉及实体及其之间的关系，包括直接和间接（传递）关系。实体是图中的节点——可以是人物、事件、对象、概念或地点。节点之间的关系是图中的边。因此，莎士比亚戏剧的本质不正是对实体（节点）及其关系（边）的活跃描绘吗？因此，也许莎士比亚本可以在他著名的宣言中写下*图*。
- en: What makes graph algorithms and graph databases so interesting and powerful
    isn’t the simple relationship between two entities, with A being related to B.
    After all, the standard relational model of databases instantiated these types
    of relationships in its foundation decades ago, in the entity relationship diagram
    (ERD). What makes graphs so remarkably important are directional relationships
    and transitive relationships. In directional relationships, A may cause B, but
    not the opposite. In transitive relationships, A can be directly related to B
    and B can be directly related to C, while A is not directly related to C, so that
    consequently A is transitively related to C.

  zh: 令人感兴趣且强大的图算法和图数据库之所以如此，不在于两个实体之间简单的关系，A与B有关系。毕竟，几十年前，标准关系数据库模型在其基础上实例化了这些类型的关系，在实体关系图（ERD）中。使图表现如此重要的是方向性关系和传递性关系。在方向性关系中，A可能导致B，但反之不然。在传递性关系中，A可以直接与B相关联，B可以直接与C相关联，而A与C之间没有直接关系，因此A与C之间存在传递性关系。
- en: With these transitivity relationships—particularly when they are numerous and
    diverse, with many possible relationship/network patterns and degrees of separation
    between the entities—the graph model uncovers relationships between entities that
    otherwise may seem disconnected or unrelated, and are undetected by a relational
    database. Hence, the graph model can be applied productively and effectively in
    many network analysis use cases.

  zh: 有了这些传递性关系——特别是当它们多样化且众多时，有许多可能的关系/网络模式和实体之间的分离度——图模型揭示了那些在关系数据库中看似断开或无关的实体之间的关系，这些关系在关系数据库中是未被检测到的。因此，图模型可以在许多网络分析用例中有效且富有成效地应用。
- en: 'Consider this marketing attribution use case: person A sees the marketing campaign;
    person A talks about it on social media; person B is connected to person A and
    sees the comment; and, subsequently, person B buys the product. From the marketing
    campaign manager’s perspective, the standard relational model fails to identify
    the attribution, since B did not see the campaign and A did not respond to the
    campaign. The campaign looks like a failure, but its actual success (and positive
    ROI) is discovered by the graph analytics algorithm through the transitive relationship
    between the marketing campaign and the final customer purchase, through an intermediary
    (entity in the middle).'

  zh: 考虑这个营销归因用例：A看到营销活动；A在社交媒体上谈论它；B与A相连并看到评论；随后，B购买了产品。从营销活动经理的角度来看，标准的关系模型无法识别归因，因为B没有看到活动，而A也没有对活动作出反应。活动看起来像是失败了，但其实际成功（和正面投资回报）是通过图分析算法发现的，通过营销活动与最终客户购买之间的传递关系，通过一个中介（中间实体）。
- en: 'Next, consider an anti-money laundering (AML) analysis case: persons A and
    C are suspected of illicit trafficking. Any interaction between the two (e.g.,
    a financial transaction in a financial database) would be flagged by the authorities,
    and heavily scrutinized. However, if A and C never transact business together,
    but instead conduct financial dealings through safe, respected, and unflagged
    financial authority B, what could pick up on the transaction? The graph analytics
    algorithm! The graph engine would discover the transitive relationship between
    A and C through intermediary B.'

  zh: 接下来，考虑一个反洗钱（AML）分析案例：被怀疑从事非法交易的人员A和C。两者之间的任何互动（例如，财务数据库中的财务交易）都将被当局标记并受到严格审查。然而，如果A和C从未共同进行业务交易，而是通过安全、受尊敬和未被标记的金融机构B进行财务交易，那么谁能发现这笔交易？图分析算法！图引擎将通过中介B发现A和C之间的传递关系。
- en: In internet searches, major search engines use a hyperlinked network (graph-based)
    algorithm to find the central authoritative node across the entire internet for
    any given set of search words. The directionality of the edge is vital in this
    case, since the authoritative node in the network is the one that many other nodes
    point at.

  zh: 在互联网搜索中，主要搜索引擎使用基于图的超链接网络算法来查找整个互联网上任何给定搜索词组的中心权威节点。在这种情况下，边的方向性至关重要，因为网络中的权威节点是许多其他节点指向的节点。
- en: With literature-based discovery (LBD)—a knowledge network (graph-based) application
    enabling significant discoveries across the knowledge base of thousands (or even
    millions) of research journal articles—“hidden knowledge” is discovered only through
    the connection between published research results that may have many degrees of
    separation (transitive relationships) between them. LBD is being applied to cancer
    research studies, where the massive semantic medical knowledge base of symptoms,
    diagnoses, treatments, drug interactions, genetic markers, short-term results,
    and long-term consequences could be “hiding” previously unknown cures or beneficial
    treatments for the most impenetrable cases. The knowledge could already be in
    the network, but we need to connect the dots to find it.

  zh: 基于文献的发现（LBD）——一种基于知识网络（图形化）的应用，能够在成千上万的研究期刊文章的知识库中实现重大发现——通过连接可能存在多度分离（传递关系）的已发表研究结果之间的关系，发现“隐藏知识”。LBD正在应用于癌症研究，其中包括症状、诊断、治疗、药物相互作用、遗传标记、短期结果和长期后果的大规模语义医学知识库，这些可能“隐藏”了先前未知的治愈方法或有益的治疗方法。知识可能已经存在于网络中，但我们需要连接点来找到它。
- en: Similar descriptions of the power of graphing can be given for the other use
    cases listed earlier, all examples of network analysis through graph algorithms.
    Each case deeply involves entities (people, objects, events, actions, concepts,
    and places) and their relationships (touch points, both causal and simple associations).

- en: When considering the power of graphing, we should keep in mind that perhaps
    the most powerful node in a graph model for real-world use cases might be “context.”
    Context may include time, location, related events, nearby entities, and more.
    Incorporating context into the graph (as nodes and as edges) can thus yield impressive
    predictive analytics and prescriptive analytics capabilities.

  zh: 在考虑图形化的力量时，我们应该记住，对于实际用例而言，图模型中可能最强大的节点可能是“上下文”。上下文可能包括时间、位置、相关事件、附近实体等。将上下文（作为节点和边）整合到图中可以产生令人印象深刻的预测分析和处方分析能力。
