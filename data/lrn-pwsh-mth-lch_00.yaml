- en: 'Sitting down to write this foreword, my first thought was, “Wow, there’s a
    lot to unpack here.” My own time with PowerShell started in 2005, about a year
    before the shell was unleashed at TechEd Barcelona 2006\. *Learn Windows PowerShell
    in a Month of Lunches*, the progenitor of this book, was far from my first PowerShell
    tome. Jeff Hicks and I wrote three editions of *Windows PowerShell: TFM* with
    SAPIEN Technologies first. After those, I actually made a decision, if you can
    imagine it, to not write any more PowerShell books! But I quickly came to realize
    that the existing selection of PowerShell books—well over a dozen by then—was
    missing a major audience need. The books of the time were teaching PowerShell
    as a programming language, aiming for the fairly large audience of VBScript coders
    that existed at the time. But PowerShell itself was aiming for a far larger and
    broader audience: nonprogrammers.'

    巴塞罗那大会发布 Shell 之前一年。“在一个月的午餐中学习 Windows PowerShell”，这本书的鼻祖，远非我写的第一本 PowerShell
    书籍。我和 Jeff Hicks 首先与 SAPIEN Technologies 合作编写了三版《Windows PowerShell: TFM》。在那之后，我实际上做出了一个决定——如果你能想象的话，就是不再写任何
    PowerShell 书籍！但很快我就意识到，当时现有的 PowerShell 书籍选择——那时已经超过十几本——缺少了一个主要受众的需求。那时的书籍都是将
    PowerShell 作为一种编程语言来教授，目标是当时相当庞大的 VBScript 编程人员群体。但 PowerShell 本身的目标是面向一个更大、更广泛的受众：非程序员。'
- en: 'That’s when I took the narratives I’d been using in live PowerShell classes
    and started constructing a new book: one that wouldn’t head directly to control-of-flow
    statements by chapter 3, and one that would really focus on a best-fit sequence
    of teaching to make learning PowerShell as easy as possible. I wanted to make,
    and keep, a promise: give me an hour a day for a month, and I’ll make you functionally
    useful in PowerShell.'

    operate on razor-thin margins, and launching a new series consumes a lot of resources.
    A different publisher originally decided to give the series a shot but backed
    out at the last minute. Manning—in what I hope has been a fantastic decision for
    them—stepped up and said, “Let’s do it.” We developed a new cover art concept

    it didn’t seek to reinvent anything. Instead, it simply wanted to take all the
    chaotic, crazy, powerful stuff that was already in the world and make it more
    consistent and easier to use. PowerShell respects Linux, for example, by not trying

    尊重 Linux，它没有试图将微软的世界观强加给那个操作系统。相反，PowerShell 只是让 Linux 已经存在的一切变得稍微容易操作一些。

    the winning style of Don Jones and Jeffery Hicks from the earlier versions, Tyler
    and Travis would work from their original chapters. Because PowerShell was now
    available on Linux and macOS, however, this book would focus on those two operating
    systems and showcase the open source/cross-platform abilities of PowerShell 7\.
    And the book would be called *Learn PowerShell in a Month of Lunches* rather than
    *Learn Windows PowerShell in a Month of Lunches*, which was the title of the first,
    second, and third editions of the classic book. Excited to see the expanded and

    the latest version of PowerShell and the Windows OS. I took what Tyler and Travis
    had started and kept the project going, making sure that all three operating systems
    were represented. The book did end up being a little Windows heavy, but that’s
    to be expected, as, again, PowerShell still has more functionality on Windows.

    character (`~`). When you see the backtick in a code listing, type it exactly
    as is. Furthermore, when it appears at the end of a line—as in the preceding example—make

- en: Manning’s commitment to our readers is to provide a venue where a meaningful
    dialogue between readers and between readers and authors can take place. It is
    not a commitment to any specific amount of participation on the part of the authors,
    whose contribution to the forum remains voluntary (and unpaid). We encourage you
    to ask them some challenging questions lest their interest stray! The forum and
    the archives of previous discussions will be accessible from the publisher’s website
    as long as the book is in print.
