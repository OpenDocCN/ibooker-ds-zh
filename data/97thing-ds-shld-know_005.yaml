- en: Phrenology, from *phren* meaning “mind” and *logos* meaning “knowledge,” was
    the study of the shapes and contours of the skull as indicative of human mental
    faculties and character traits. It was developed initially by Franz Joseph Gall
    (1758–1828) and grew to an internationally recognized science and practice throughout
    the 19th century. A related area of science that emerged in the 19th century and
    continued throughout the 20th century was eugenics. Although these practices once
    had scientific support and popular appeal, both have been wholly debunked. So
    what do these discredited pseudosciences have to do with data science ethics?
    When we consider the methods, applications, and zeitgeist of their day, some eerie
    echoes reverberate across time to provide a cautionary tale.

  zh: 颅相学，取自希腊词根*phren*（意为“心灵”）和*logos*（意为“知识”），研究颅骨的形状和轮廓，表征人类的心智能力和性格特征。它最初由弗朗茨·约瑟夫·加尔（1758–1828）开发，并在19世纪成为国际公认的科学和实践领域。19世纪兴起的一个相关科学领域，持续至20世纪，是优生学。尽管这些做法曾一度得到科学支持和广泛欢迎，但它们现在已经被完全揭穿。那么这些被证伪的伪科学与数据科学伦理有什么关系呢？当我们考虑它们的方法、应用和时代精神时，一些不寻常的共鸣在时间的洪流中回响，为我们提供了一个警示性故事。

  zh: 那么，颅相学家和优生学家做了什么？
- en: Phrenologists used scientific instruments such as tape measures and calipers
    to record the size and map the contours of people’s heads. They believed the brain
    was an organ that grew or atrophied from natural predispositions or repeated use,
    and thus the size, shape, and bumps of a person’s head reflected the growth of
    the brain underneath. They used their measurements of these features, along with
    behavioral observations, to infer certain aspects of personality and character.

  zh: 颅相学家使用卷尺和游标卡尺等科学仪器记录人们头部的大小并勾画其轮廓。他们认为大脑是一个器官，根据自然倾向或反复使用而生长或萎缩，因此一个人头部的大小、形状和凸起反映了大脑下的生长情况。他们利用这些特征的测量数据以及行为观察来推断个性和性格的某些方面。
- en: Eugenicists used similar techniques but measured the whole body, focusing especially
    on physiological differences. Grounding their work in a form of “social Darwinism,”
    they inferred that these measurements pointed to the superiority or inferiority
    of certain racial characteristics, and they encouraged processes like selective
    breeding to improve population health. For well over a hundred years, the “sciences”
    of phrenology and eugenics were well regarded as attempts to understand human
    behavior and physiological variation, especially since they were supported by
    seemingly unbiased scientific measurements.

  zh: 问题出在哪里？
- en: Although phrenology and eugenics had accurate measurement tools and well-documented
    findings, the results were based on false assumptions, poorly collected data,
    and nonrepresentative samples. Although phrenologists constructed their models
    empirically, the underlying mental faculties that they inferred from those measurements
    were created by studying friends whom they believed had those faculties (convenience
    samples) and were tested on inmates of jails and asylums (biased samples). Eugenicists
    also were selective in the groups they compared, primarily using the tools and
    findings to support the deeply held stereotypes and racist ideologies of the time
    (confirmation bias). Ultimately, eugenics research became the foundation of Nationalsozialistische
    Rassenhygiene, or “National Socialist racial hygiene,” of Germany’s Nazi regime,
    which led to the deaths of nearly 10 million individuals who were supposedly inferior.
    Although we can now look back on these methods and critique them, it is also easy
    to understand how individuals at the time may have believed these conclusions,
    which were shrouded in the cloak of science.

- en: Data science is a quantitative science based on massive amounts of continuously
    created data, analyzed quickly by complex algorithms, apparently at population-level
    scale, and free of a priori assumptions. It is easy to see why it is gaining widespread
    acceptance across business and society. Data scientists spend a great amount of
    time developing models and drawing conclusions from apparently “naturally occurring”
    phenomena, which in most cases are the trails that we leave in our digital lives.
    Not unlike the bumps on our heads, the length of our legs, or the shape of our
    noses, these digital trails are things that tell us something important about
    ourselves as humans in a society...right?

- en: In his book *Everybody Lies*, Seth Stephens-Davidowitz convincingly and compellingly
    illustrates how Google Trends data offers insights into almost Freudian-like subconscious
    human behavior.^([1](ch04.xhtml#ch01fn1)) This is part of the power of data science—it
    can tell us things about ourselves that even we may not be aware of (or are too
    scared to admit to). On the other hand, Cathy O’Neil, in her book *Weapons of
    Math Destruction*, argues that AI and predictive algorithms are only as good as
    the data fed into them, and more often than not, the results of these apparently
    unbiased algorithms and models are nothing more than a replication of existing
    social inequities.^([2](ch04.xhtml#ch01fn2)) Rather than giving us information
    to predict the unknown, O’Neil provides examples of ways that data science techniques
    penalize, marginalize, and disenfranchise those who are already at risk in our
    society. Many others have also uncovered the faulty assumptions underlying AI
    algorithms designed more for efficiency than accuracy; the racial and gender bias
    of some facial recognition algorithms; online advertising that shows high-income
    jobs to men more often than to women; crime predicting and criminal sentencing
    algorithms that discriminate against the poor and people of color; the opacity
    of the secondary data market that unfairly discriminates against people in the
    insurance and credit market; and hiring algorithms that have violated the Americans
    with Disabilities Act.

    这正是数据科学的力量的一部分——它可以告诉我们关于自己的事情，甚至是我们自己可能不自觉的（或者太害怕承认的）。另一方面，Cathy O'Neil在她的书 *Weapons
    of Math Destruction* 中认为，人工智能和预测算法的好坏取决于输入的数据，而这些表面上没有偏见的算法和模型的结果往往只是对现有社会不平等的复制。^([2](ch04.xhtml#ch01fn2))
    而不是给我们提供预测未知的信息，O'Neil提供了数据科学技术惩罚、边缘化和剥夺社会风险群体的例子。许多其他人也揭示了设计更注重效率而非准确性的AI算法背后的错误假设；一些面部识别算法的种族和性别偏见；在线广告更频繁地向男性展示高收入工作而不是女性；预测犯罪和刑罚算法对贫困人群和有色人种的歧视；二级数据市场的不透明性不公平地歧视了保险和信贷市场的人们；以及违反《美国残疾人法案》的招聘算法。
- en: Just like craniometer or femur length measurements, data science tools may be
    accurate in what they measure, but the conclusions drawn may be no better than
    equating an enlarged lobe in rear section 21 to “amativeness.” Unless data scientists
    collaborate with subject matter experts when developing their data and methods,
    their conclusions could be based on faulty assumptions or on insufficient or biased
    data. The major problem? AI algorithms involve complex mathematics and computer
    programming beyond the understanding of most people, but people trust them because
    “numbers are unbiased.” The complexity of data science methods often means it
    is difficult to interrogate algorithms, leaving them shrouded in the invisibility
    cloak of science. Excessive belief in something because it is done scientifically
    is *scientism*, not science.

    policy-making bodies have attempted to create ethical guidelines (e.g., GDPR and
    the California Consumer Privacy Act) for the collection and uses of data to limit
    the risks to individuals and protected groups, these efforts mostly fall into
    the category of “reactive” ethics. The impact of these efforts is as of yet as
    unclear as many of the algorithms and statistical techniques they are attempting

- en: It is imperative that data scientists become intentional about collaborating
    with other scientists, scrutinize the data they use, develop ethical codes to
    follow, and be open to critique of their methods. This is essential to avoid being
    painted into the same corner of scientism and logical fallacies that helped bring
    down other, less rigorous scientific movements of the past. Otherwise, we may
