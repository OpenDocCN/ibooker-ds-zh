- en: One of the challenges of data science today is the availability of many datasets
    that can be assembled together for a use case (i.e., to provide a 360-degree view
    of the customer), such that the resulting integrated dataset creates toxic combinations
    of data, including information that might be misused if in the wrong hands.

  zh: 当今数据科学的挑战之一是许多数据集的可用性，可以为一个使用案例（即提供客户的360度视图）组装在一起，从而创建出毒性数据组合，包括在错误的手中可能被误用的信息。
- en: Consider that if you combine customer information and shopping history (in the
    case of a retailer of consumer product goods with direct-to-customer sales) with
    US Census Bureau information and CDC natality (birth rate) statistics, you can
    determine a lot about a household—too much, in fact. For example, you can determine
    the members of the household and their education levels and incomes, the items
    they’ve purchased on a regular basis, the age of children in the household, and
    so on.

  zh: 考虑一下，如果将客户信息和购物历史（在直接向客户销售消费品的零售商的情况下）与美国人口调查局的信息和CDC的出生率（出生率）统计信息结合起来，你可以确定一个家庭的很多信息——实际上是太多了。例如，你可以确定家庭成员及其教育水平和收入、他们定期购买的物品、家庭中孩子的年龄等等。
- en: We have learned that the right people should see the right data at the right
    time with the right quality (a standard in data governance programs), but has
    your organization considered the use cases for information at this level of detail?
    One way to limit people from viewing Personally Identifiable Information (PII),
    or to limit the creation of toxic combinations of information (e.g., name, address,
    age, and phone number), is to “sign data out” from your data lake (or customer
    information hub) for usage during a given duration or time period. Along with
    the signed-out data, people would get obfuscated information about name, address,
    phone number, and other key information that would identify a consumer. If the
    use case was trying to find out what shoppers are purchasing, this could be identified,
    and the organization would have to blind consumers’ PII.

  zh: 我们已经学到，正确的人应该在正确的时间以正确的质量看到正确的数据（这是数据治理项目的标准），但是你的组织是否考虑过此详细级别信息的使用案例？限制人们查看个人身份信息（PII），或者限制信息的毒性组合（例如，姓名、地址、年龄和电话号码），一种方法是从您的数据湖（或客户信息中心）“签出数据”，在给定的时间段内供使用。除了签出的数据外，人们还会得到关于姓名、地址、电话号码和其他可以识别消费者的关键信息的模糊化信息。如果使用案例试图找出购物者正在购买什么，这可以被识别出来，组织将不得不盲目处理消费者的PII。
- en: At a large retailer, we removed the ability of a query to run against these
    types of fields and simultaneously blinded the data returned. We also limited
    any query that returned fewer than 10 results—for the reason that if you lived
    in a very small town (say, a population of 50), you could probably identify the
    individual(s) if the results were fewer than 10\. We could envision that an unethical
    individual would want to see what their neighbors were purchasing. If a data scientist
    needed to know more, they would have to justify to an ethics committee their reasoning
    for the request.

  zh: 在一家大型零售商，我们取消了允许查询同时运行这些类型字段并同时盲目返回数据的功能。我们还限制了任何返回少于10个结果的查询——因为如果你住在一个非常小的城镇（比如，人口50），如果结果少于10个，你可能能够识别出个体。我们可以设想，一个不道德的个人可能想要知道他们的邻居在购买什么。如果数据科学家需要了解更多信息，他们必须向伦理委员会证明请求的理由。
- en: Consider a health care provider who combines many internal and external datasets
    and can now determine, for example, who has AIDS in a specific community. This
    would expose the organization to a HIPAA violation, not to mention be highly unethical!
    To prevent this from happening, we would again allow queries where the result
    set had to return more than 50 results in order to allow access. The key here
    is to determine what sensitive data, when combined with other datasets (both internal
    and external), could result in the exposition or identification of an individual
    (referred to earlier as toxic combinations of data).

  zh: 想象一个医疗服务提供商，他结合了许多内部和外部数据集，现在可以确定在特定社区中谁患有艾滋病。这将使组织面临HIPAA违规，更不用说这是极不道德的！为了防止这种情况发生，我们再次允许查询结果集必须返回超过50个结果以便允许访问。关键在于确定哪些敏感数据，在与其他数据集（包括内部和外部的）结合时，可能导致个人的暴露或识别（早先称为数据的有毒组合）。
- en: Consider also the case where an employee wants to pull a very large portion
    of your customer file or data lake—what use case could they have that would require
    this amount of information? Is it possible that this is an individual who is considering
    leaving and taking this information with them? Limiting the result set’s maximum
    size is also a consideration in this situation.

  zh: 还考虑一种情况，员工想要提取您的客户文件或数据湖的一个非常大的部分——他们可能有什么使用案例需要这么多信息？有可能是一个正在考虑离职并带走这些信息的个人吗？在这种情况下，限制结果集的最大大小也是需要考虑的。
- en: This type of blocking and tackling in the data space is now a reality, and organizations
    have to plan and prepare for securing their information assets as they would their
    monetary assets. For example, would you allow a single employee to withdraw $1
    million in cash without any checks and balances? We all know the answer is no,
    so why treat datasets any differently?

  zh: 这种在数据空间中的阻塞和铲除现在已经成为现实，组织必须像保护货币资产一样计划和准备保护其信息资产。例如，您会允许单个员工在没有任何检查和平衡的情况下提取100万美元现金吗？我们都知道答案是否定的，那么为什么要对数据集采取不同的对待方式呢？
