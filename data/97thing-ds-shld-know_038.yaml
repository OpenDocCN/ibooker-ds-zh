- en: In the past few years, you must have noticed depressingly regular reports of
    data breaches, cloud leaks, and cyberattacks occurring. It would be easy to tell
    ourselves the problem is that hackers have become so much smarter, or that the
    systems have become too complex to manage, but the reality is that tech organizations
    don’t take their own security sufficiently seriously, and they don’t treat our
    personal data with the stewardship that we would hope for from them. These organizations
    think of our personal data as a commodity that can be bought, sold, and traded
    on the markets. What they don’t realize is that our personal data represents fragments
    of our lives. When a data breach occurs, it is often we as individuals who suffer,
    as the breach adds to our stress, subtracts from our time, multiplies our fears,
    and divides us from other people.

  zh: 在过去几年中，您一定已经注意到频繁发生的数据泄露、云泄漏和网络攻击的报告。我们可能会轻易告诉自己问题在于黑客变得更聪明了，或者系统变得过于复杂而难以管理，但事实是科技组织并未对自身的安全性足够认真，也没有像我们希望的那样对待我们的个人数据。这些组织把我们的个人数据视为可以在市场上买卖和交易的商品。他们没有意识到我们的个人数据代表着我们生活的片段。当发生数据泄露时，通常是我们作为个体遭受损失，因为泄露增加了我们的压力，减少了我们的时间，增加了我们的恐惧，并与他人产生隔阂。
- en: This issue is most noticeable in the case of cloud storage, where leaks are
    constant; the organizations that employ these services appear to have little understanding
    of how their cloud instances are configured and seem unable to audit and manage
    them. These misconfigured instances (usually storage buckets or databases left
    accessible to the general public) have been responsible for many of the largest
    data leaks in recent years. The issue isn’t simply that the IT personnel responsible
    for managing this relatively new technology don’t know how to configure these
    systems, but rather that they lack the integrity to admit their lack of knowledge,
    and as a result they misconfigure systems that leave millions of records exposed,
    with many people’s lives inconvenienced.

  zh: 这个问题在云存储的情况下尤为明显，泄漏是持续的；使用这些服务的组织似乎对其云实例的配置了解甚少，似乎无法对其进行审计和管理。这些配置错误的实例（通常是留给公众访问的存储桶或数据库）是近年来许多最大数据泄漏事件的罪魁祸首。问题并不仅仅在于负责管理这一相对新技术的IT人员不知道如何配置这些系统，而是他们缺乏承认自己知识不足的诚信，结果误配置的系统导致数百万记录暴露，许多人的生活受到影响。
- en: To solve this problem, we need to start in the third-level institutes, the colleges
    and universities, and transform the curriculum to make probity, integrity, and,
    most importantly, ethics central in all computer science degrees. A revolution
    is needed to imbue these students with a deeply rooted sense of ethics, beyond
    the legal requirements, beyond the professional guidelines, and toward a sense
    of kindness and fellowship with others in all their actions. Ethics must be presented
    and taught in such a way that it will become second nature to students, so that
    they will never program a computer system without first considering the ethical
    implications of what they are doing. The content of this new curriculum is being
    created for us on a daily basis. As we read of more and more examples of organizations
    that demonstrate carelessness and thoughtlessness in their conduct, we can use
    these parables to create a new breed of caring and thoughtful students, whose
    ethical skills we can nurture.

  zh: 要解决这个问题，我们需要从第三级机构，即学院和大学开始，改革课程，使正直、诚信，尤其是伦理成为所有计算机科学学位的核心。我们需要进行一场革命，灌输这些学生一种根深蒂固的伦理感，超越法律要求，超越专业指南，朝向一种对他人善良和团结的意识。伦理必须以这样的方式呈现和教授，以至于对学生来说成为第二天性，这样他们在编写计算机系统时首先考虑其伦理影响。这种新课程的内容正在我们每天的生活中被创造。随着我们阅读越来越多组织在其行为中表现出的粗心和轻率，我们可以利用这些寓言来培养一种新一代关心和深思熟虑的学生，我们可以培养他们的伦理技能。
- en: Abraham Lincoln said that “the dogmas of the quiet past, are inadequate to the
    stormy present. The occasion is piled high with difficulty, and we must rise—with
    the occasion. As our case is new, so we must think anew, and act anew.” Now more
    than ever, we must act anew to create professionals who consider their actions,
    who admit their shortcomings, and who reflect on whose lives they can affect.

  zh: 亚伯拉罕·林肯说过，“过去的教条在如今的风雨飘摇中已然不足。现在的形势困难重重，我们必须与形势同步。因为我们的情况是新的，所以我们必须有新的思维，新的行动。”现在比以往任何时候都更需要我们采取新的行动，培养那些考虑他们行动后果的专业人士，那些能够承认自己缺点并反思自己行动影响的人。
