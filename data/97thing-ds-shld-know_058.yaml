    involved image or object recognition. Typical examples include examining pictures
    to identify a cat or a dog, some famous person, and so on.

    daily lives? What if pictures or video captured you walking down the street or
    around a shopping mall, or on your way to work or to a meeting? These pictures
    and videos are already being taken of you without you knowing.

- en: 'This raises a wide range of ethical concerns. There are the ethics of deploying
    such solutions in the public domain, but there are also ethical concerns for the
    data scientists and other people working on these projects. Remember: just because
    we can doesn’t mean we should. People need to decide, if they are working on one
    of these projects, whether they *should* be working on it—and if not, what they
    can do.'

  zh: 这引发了广泛的伦理关切。部署这类解决方案在公共领域存在伦理问题，但在这些项目上工作的数据科学家和其他人也存在伦理顾虑。记住：我们可以做某事并不意味着我们应该这样做。人们需要决定，如果他们正在从事这类项目，他们是否*应该*从事这类项目，如果不应该，他们可以做什么。
- en: Ethics are principles of behavior based on ideas of right and wrong. Ethical
    principles often focus on ideas such as fairness, respect, responsibility, integrity,
    quality, transparency, and trust. A lot of ideas are there, but we all need to
    consider what is right and what is wrong. But what about the gray-area, borderline
    scenarios in which an interesting project in an experimental environment, once
    deployed, leads to ethical concerns?

  zh: 伦理是基于对对错观念的行为准则。伦理原则通常关注公平、尊重、责任、诚信、质量、透明度和信任等理念。有很多理念，但我们都需要考虑什么是对的，什么是错的。但是，在一个实验环境中，一个有趣的项目一旦部署，就会引发伦理关注的灰色地带、边缘情景呢？
- en: 'Here are some examples that might fall into the gray space between right and
    wrong. (Why they might fall more toward the wrong is because most people are not
    aware their image is being captured and used, and not just for a particular purpose
    at capture time: their images are stored longer term to allow for better machine
    learning models to be built.)'

    of this is in the film *Minority Report.* Only this is no longer science fiction;
    it is happening at shopping centers across Europe. These digital advertising screens
    are monitoring people, identifying their personal characteristics, and then customizing
    the ads to match the profiles of the people walking past. The companies behind
    these technologies are using deep learning to profile individuals based on gender,

    street. Some have taken this to another level, where they can identify what brands
    of clothing you are wearing. Imagine if you could combine this personal monitoring
    with location-based services. For example, you are walking down a street, and
    people approach you and try to entice you into a particular store by offering
    certain discounts. But you are with a friend, and the store is not interested
    in them. The store is using video monitoring, capturing details of every person
    walking down the street and about to pass the store. The video is using deep learning
    to analyze your profile and what brands you are wearing. The store has deployed
    a team of people to stop and engage with certain individuals, just because they
    match the brands or interests of the store. Depending on what brands you are wearing,
    they may offer customized discounts specific to you.

- en: This can be an ethical dilemma for a data scientist. You may have worked on
    an interesting project in a lab or an experimental environment. The real challenge
    comes when this work is taken out of the lab and deployed for commercial gain.
    Your ethical responsibility involves looking at all aspects of how the project
    is deployed and its implications. It is easy to understand why retail outlets
    are interested in these technologies, but as data scientists we need to consider
    the ethics of applying technologies to these types of projects, and whether we
    as humans are OK with our work being used in this manner.
