- en: When [Harvard Business Review](https://oreil.ly/30Gpb) dubbed “data scientist”
    the “sexiest job of the 21st century” in 2012, this raised awareness of the importance
    of data jobs (data analyst, data scientist, data engineer, data storyteller, etc.)
    when it comes to business outcomes. Although the true business impact was yet
    to be proved and the differences between data titles blurry, the race to hire
    and retain the best talent was on—and the competition was grueling! Tremendous
    pressure was put on companies to provide large compensation packages and offer
    outstanding benefits to attract candidates in their direction. Naturally, existing
    data-centric companies were ahead of the curve, with established data teams, already
    existing reliance on data systems, and they set the bar for data practice standards.
    It’s no wonder that all the best talent was sitting at FANG (Facebook, Amazon,
    Netflix, and Google), among other large tech companies. They were offering large
    comp packages, but in exchange, they were asking for a candidate with exceptional
    technical, strategic, leadership, and domain expertise—an all-around unicorn.

    and trade-offs needed to be made. Understanding that you may find a technically
    strong candidate who lacks domain experience or vice versa meant accepting that
    an investment in learning and development was not just beneficial, but necessary.
    In the case where you were not willing to settle for anything less than the perfect
    candidate, well, your only enemy would be time. How long could you wait before
    filling this role? How would projects and deliverables be impacted by keeping
    this role open for an extended period of time? Ultimately, your decision would

    you are aiming to train for are “in scope” or not. If the answer is no, you’ll

    alternatively, generalists who are keen to learn and eager to grow can supplement
    and enthuse an existing team. Additionally, hiring with diversity in mind can
    mean better business outcomes. Research clearly shows that diverse teams and companies
    show better business outcomes than their less diverse counterparts. For example,
    research by Fundera found that “racially and ethnically diverse companies are
    35% more likely to perform better, while diverse teams are 70% more likely to
    capture and penetrate new markets.”^([1](ch05.html#id517)) Nowadays, most companies
    have specific diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives that help enforce
    this from the top, with sourcing sprints and training for hiring managers to help
    attract diverse candidates into the applicant pool. However, if your company doesn’t
    have these practices in place, you can always work to be more intentional about
    your hiring practices—look to incorporate inclusive language in your requisitions

    use cases. It will be up to you to keep abreast of these tools and look for ways
    to test, foster learning, and find ways to leverage these tools within your team.
    Thus, your approach to learning and development for the team should continuously
    encourage independent learning through smaller projects, or a sandbox where ideas
    and tools can be tested. This will require team members with the skills necessary
    to run the new or improved systems you have set up for the team. This could be

    your analytics team will exist as a separate entity in the organization, responsible
    for servicing all stakeholders through a central queue. One of the biggest benefits
    of this structure is that it allows all requests to come through you for prioritization
    before being delegated to for analysis. This can allow you time to understand,
    refine, and prioritize tasks based on business needs and desired impact. Additionally,
    you can consolidate tasks that are duplicative across multiple stakeholders, creating
    one reporting output that satisfies multiple needs. This leans in to principles
    like the 80/20 rule, which suggests that 20% of your effort will cover 80% of
    the tasks coming to the team. This is the philosophy that drives the engine of
    a centralized team, as they tackle big projects that can help accommodate the
    majority of use cases and needs across a business. There are many other benefits
    of this approach beyond prioritization, such as knowledge sharing, report standardization,
    and peer-to-peer mentorship. With centralized structures in place, your team will

- en: The downsides to a centralized approach can come from lack of domain expertise
    as more complex team-specific tasks in the queue are assigned. Analysts taking
    on these tasks may be less familiar with the nuances of the metrics and the stakeholders,
    which will lead to time delays to get the output completed. Unfortunately, this
    can leave some teams with specific needs at a disadvantage, wherein they may have
    limited support, and at times may be flying blind. Circumventing this may be challenging
    due to competing priorities, but maintaining strong communication flows with all
    stakeholders regarding what the team is focused on, and when they can expect their
    needs to be met, could help calm the waters.

- en: In a *decentralized* approach, as seen in [Figure 5-2](#fig_2_decentralized_approach_adapted_from),
    your team is integrated into business units within the organization. Analysts
    are aligned to business units and are immersed in their day-to-day workflows,
    metrics, reporting, and management. Their role will require them to handle the
    tasks coming out of their respective teams and allow them to focus on tailored
    and nuanced reporting that satisfies the needs of the business unit. Additionally,
    they can become thought partners with their stakeholders. The biggest advantage
    to this approach involves the “need for speed.” By aligning your team to business
    units, they also function as domain experts and can more quickly turn around output
    as compared to teams using centralized approach.

    member to manage their prioritization of tasks within their business group. Depending
    on the individual/stakeholder relationship and the team members’ comfort with
    pushing back, this can (at times) lead to feelings of being overwhelmed. Finally,
    when the team is distributed in this way, silos are naturally created, and there
    is less collaboration among team members. As a leader, you will likely want to
    accommodate this by creating forums and other means of knowledge sharing and collaboration.
