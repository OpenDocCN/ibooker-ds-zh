- en: With the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, the laws around personal
    data and ethics are going to change dramatically. Signed by Governor Jerry Brown
    in 2018 and put into effect in January 2020, the law aims to establish guidelines
    and procedures to protect private information for residents of California. The
    law grants the consumer the right to know what personal information a business
    has and the business purpose for its collection and monetization, as well as many
    other things.

  zh: 随着《加州消费者隐私法案》（CCPA）的出台，关于个人数据和道德的法律将发生巨大变化。该法案由杰里·布朗州长于2018年签署，并于2020年1月生效，旨在为加州居民建立保护私人信息的准则和程序。该法案赋予消费者知晓企业拥有的个人信息及其收集和变现目的的权利，以及许多其他内容。
- en: 'The CCPA is a good idea, and many other states will soon follow the lead of
    California. However, there is a downside to these types of laws. All organizations
    that are data driven will have to comply with this law or face some steep consequences.
    And let’s face it: most organizations are data driven! I am sure we all will see
    a reduction in our email inboxes as organizations tighten their belts on the amount
    of consumer advertising they do. This will also have an impact on traditional
    marketing. Robocalls will be greatly reduced. Sounds like a dream come true for
    many people. However: spam! I think you are going to miss it!'

  zh: CCPA是一个好主意，许多其他州很快也将效仿加州的先行。然而，这类法律也有其不利之处。所有依赖数据的组织都必须遵守这项法律，否则将面临严重后果。让我们面对现实：大多数组织都依赖数据！我相信我们都将看到电子邮箱的垃圾邮件量减少，因为组织将在消费者广告上收紧腰带。这也将对传统营销产生影响。自动拨号电话将大大减少。对于许多人来说，这听起来像是美梦成真。然而，垃圾邮件！我认为你会错过它的！
- en: Believe it or not, I love getting some spam from advertisers! I want to know
    what the next best offer is and whether I am able to get a good deal at the pump.
    I like receiving messages that tell me about movies that are coming out and that
    I might get 50% off of that pricey yet yummy popcorn. What I fear is that the
    pendulum will swing and businesses will tighten up their marketing out of fear
    of violating new privacy laws like CCPA. I won’t, however, miss the robocalls!

  zh: 信不信由你，我喜欢从广告商那里收到一些垃圾邮件！我想知道下一个最佳优惠是什么，我是否能在加油站得到便宜的油价。我喜欢收到关于即将上映的电影的信息，以及我可能会得到高昂但美味的爆米花50%折扣的消息。我担心的是摇摆不定的情况将会导致企业因害怕违反像CCPA这样的新隐私法律而收紧他们的市场营销。然而，我不会想念那些自动拨号电话！
- en: Are we entering a time when we have a “bigger brother”? One thing I don’t like
    about the CCPA law is that it takes control away from me. I can manage my own
    spam and robocalls. It is easy enough for me to manage my data! Besides, spam
    filters work pretty well. I can unsubscribe from emails too. The new call blocker
    apps are pretty awesome. I really don’t require a big government oversight group
    looking out for me; I can look out for myself.

  zh: 我们是否正在进入一个“更大的兄弟”的时代？我不喜欢CCPA法律的一点是它夺走了我对自己的控制权。我可以管理自己的垃圾邮件和自动拨号电话。管理我的数据对我来说也很容易！此外，垃圾邮件过滤器效果很好。我也可以取消订阅邮件。新的呼叫拦截应用程序也非常棒。我真的不需要一个大型政府监督组织来照看我；我可以自己照看自己。
- en: In conclusion, I am a data-about-me show-off. But that is me, and that may not
    be all right with you. We all have a responsibility to protect ourselves and our
    private data. The CCPA is a well-intentioned set of regulations. It serves to
    protect private data and consumers. But we all know that the road to hell is paved
    with good intentions. Sometimes it does seem a bit creepy when I am walking near
    a store and I receive an email with an offer from that establishment. At the same
    time, the consumer in me gets a little excited if the offer is right! I would
    rather keep control and don’t mind that there are very smart data scientists constructing
    my next best offer, even if they use my personal data. After all, data, analytics,
    marketing, and data monetization are a big part of our economy! I say laissez-faire—“hands
    off!”

  zh: 总之，我是一个喜欢炫耀个人数据的人。但这是我，也许你不会喜欢。我们都有责任保护自己和我们的私人数据。《加州消费者隐私法案》是一套出于良好意图的法规。它旨在保护私人数据和消费者。但我们都知道，通往地狱的路常常铺满了善意的石块。有时候当我在商店附近走动时，收到来自该商店的优惠邮件，感觉有点诡异。同时，作为消费者，如果优惠合适，我会有些兴奋！我宁愿保持控制，不介意有很聪明的数据科学家在构建我的下一个最佳优惠时使用我的个人数据。毕竟，数据、分析、营销和数据变现是我们经济的重要组成部分！我说放任自流——“别碰我！”
