- en: Data science is a means to an end—specifically, a means to improve decision
    making. If data science does not improve decision making, it has no value. As
    Goethe said, “Knowing is not enough; we must apply. Willing is not enough; we
    must do.” It is not enough that we use data science to know something; we must
    act on what it tells us.

  zh: 数据科学是达到目的的手段，具体而言是改善决策。如果数据科学不能改善决策，它就没有价值。正如歌德所说：“知之为知之，行之方行之。”仅仅知道某事是不够的；我们必须根据它告诉我们的去行动。
- en: When it comes to ethics, this leads to the conclusion that it is not enough
    that data science is ethical; it must be used ethically also. The decisions we
    make with data science must be ethical. We must be clear about the moral principles
    that govern how we conduct our decision making.

  zh: 从伦理角度来看，这导致一个结论：仅仅数据科学是伦理的是不够的，它还必须被伦理地使用。我们用数据科学做出的决策必须是伦理的。我们必须明确统治我们进行决策的道德原则。
- en: Ensuring decisions are made ethically with data science has two elements. We
    must design our decision-making approaches to be ethical, and we must be able
    to demonstrate that any specific decision we have made was ethical.

  zh: 确保用数据科学做出的决策具有伦理性有两个要素。我们必须设计我们的决策方法以确保其伦理性，并且我们必须能够证明我们做出的每一个具体决策都是伦理的。

  zh: 设计伦理决策系统
- en: Most decisions that use data science are made repeatedly. Data science relies
    on having data about how decisions were made in the past, and this focuses it
    on high-volume, repeatable decisions about transactions or consumers. Should we
    pay this claim? Can this person have credit? What’s the right treatment for this
    patient? Is this person who they say they are? These day-to-day decisions are
    the prime use case for data science.

  zh: 大多数使用数据科学的决策都是重复性的。数据科学依赖于过去决策的数据，这使其专注于关于交易或消费者的高频、可重复的决策。我们应该支付这笔索赔吗？这个人能否获得信用？对这位患者来说，什么是正确的治疗方法？这个人是不是他们声称的那个人？这些日常决策是数据科学的主要用例。
- en: Because these decisions are made more than once, we can define a decision-making
    approach to follow each time. This might have been done in the past with a policy
    and procedure manual or checklist. Today it’s more likely to be defined using
    a more rigorous model of decision making, such as the Decision Model and Notation
    (DMN) standard.

  zh: 因为这些决策不止一次地被做出，我们可以定义一个决策方法，每次都遵循这个方法。过去可能是通过政策和流程手册或清单来完成的。如今更可能是使用更严格的决策模型来定义，比如决策模型和符号（DMN）标准。
- en: You can clearly show the role of data science in such a defined decision-making
    approach. You can show, for instance, that the data science does not impact eligibility
    but that it is used only to identify a risk of fraud, or that the prediction of
    credit risk is not used in the calculation of a discount. You can define when
    the data science makes a difference to the decision making and when it does not.
    Was a decision to refer someone for manual review made because of a data science
    result or to reject them out of hand, for instance?

  zh: 您可以清楚地展示数据科学在这种明确定义的决策方法中的作用。例如，您可以展示数据科学并不影响资格，而是仅用于识别欺诈风险，或者预测信用风险并不用于折扣计算。您可以定义数据科学何时对决策产生影响，何时不产生影响。例如，是否因为数据科学的结果而决定将某人提交手动审查，或者直接拒绝他们？
- en: Only if you can clearly define the decisions impacted by your data science can
    you be sure you have defined an ethical approach to your decision making.

- en: Being able to show that you are proactive in designing an ethical approach to
    decision making must be complemented by an ability to demonstrate that you applied
    such an approach in the decisions you made. It’s all very well to show that a
    prediction of fraud is not enough to have someone rejected out of hand, but when
    someone *is* rejected, they may demand proof—or a regulator may.

  zh: 能够展示您在设计伦理决策方法方面是积极主动的，必须配以展示您在做出决策时应用了这样的方法的能力。仅仅展示预测欺诈不足以让某人被直接拒绝是不够的，被拒绝的人可能要求证明，或者监管机构可能要求。
- en: Those elements of the decision that are automated must create a record of how
    the decision was made, the business rules or decision logic that was executed.
    Manual decisions must be recorded by the user. These logs must be combined with
    the data science results—and ideally with an explanation of those results. Especially
    when significant elements of the decisions are automated, creating and storing
    these logs can be a side effect of making the decision.

  zh: 自动化决策的元素必须创建记录，记录决策如何做出、执行的业务规则或决策逻辑。用户必须记录手动决策。这些日志必须与数据科学结果结合——最好还包括对这些结果的解释。特别是当决策的重要部分是自动化时，创建和存储这些日志可能是决策的副产品。
- en: Keeping these logs allows any decision to be reviewed to ensure an ethical decision
    was made. This information also supports continual improvement and review of the
    decision-making process/system/approach. How might the decision-making approach
    be refined to make better decisions? Are there circumstances in which the data
    science should have been consulted or where its usage was unhelpful? Only data
    about how the decision was made can support this kind of analysis and turn machine
    learning into business learning.

    also have an ethical approach to our data science–enabled decision making.
