  zh: 如何阅读这本书
- en: Software has been running the world for a while. As consumers, we are used to
    applications that make it faster, smarter, and more efficient for us to do things
    like calling a cab or depositing a paycheck. Increasingly, our health, education,
    entertainment, social life, and employment are all enhanced by modern software
    applications. At the other end of those applications is a chain of enterprises,
    large and small, that deliver these improved experiences, services, and products.
    Modern applications are deployed not just in the hands of consumers but also at
    points along this enterprise supply chain. Major transactional systems in many
    traditional industries such as retail, media, financial services, education, and
    logistics are gradually being replaced by modern microservices that autoupdate
    frequently, scale efficiently, and incorporate more real-time intelligence. New
    digital-first startups are using this opportunity to disrupt traditional business
    models, whereas enterprise incumbents are rushing to modernize their systems so
    they can compete and avoid disruption.

  zh: 1.1 现代应用程序的解剖结构
- en: What is a modern application? When you think of software that has improved your
    life, perhaps you think of applications that are interactive, fast (low latency),
    connected, intelligent, context aware, reliable, secure, and easy to use on any
    device. As technology advances, the capabilities of modern applications, such
    as the level of security, reliability, awareness, and intelligence, advance as
    well. For example, new development frameworks such as React and Angular have greatly
    enhanced the level of interactivity of applications, and new runtimes like Node.js
    have increased functionality. Modern applications have the property of constantly
    getting better through frequent updates. On the backend, these applications often
    comprise many services that are all continuously improving. This modularity is
    attained by breaking the older “monolith” pattern for writing applications, where
    all the various functions were tightly coupled to each other.

  zh: 什么是现代应用程序？当你想到那些改善你生活的软件时，你可能想到的是那些交互性强、快速（低延迟）、连接性强、智能、具有情境感知、可靠、安全且在任何设备上易于使用的应用程序。随着技术的进步，现代应用程序的能力，如安全性、可靠性、感知能力和智能水平，也在不断提高。例如，新的开发框架如React和Angular极大地提高了应用程序的交互性水平，而新的运行时如Node.js则增加了功能。现代应用程序具有通过频繁更新不断改进的特性。在后台，这些应用程序通常由许多持续改进的服务组成。这种模块化是通过打破旧的“单体”应用程序编写模式实现的，在这种模式中，所有各种功能都紧密耦合在一起。
- en: 'Applications written as a set of modules or microservices offer several benefits:
    constituent services can be evolved independently or replaced with other, more
    scalable or otherwise superior, services over time. Also, the modern microservices
    pattern is better at separating concerns and setting contracts between services,
    making it easier to inspect and fix problems. This approach to writing, updating,
    and deploying applications as microservices that can be used together but also
    updated, scaled, and debugged independently is at the heart of modern software
    development. In this book, we refer to this pattern as “modern” or “cloud native”
    application development. The term *cloud native* applies here because the microservices
    pattern is well suited to run on distributed infrastructure or the cloud. Microservices
    can be rolled out incrementally, scaled, revised, replaced, scheduled, rescheduled,
    and bin packed tightly on distributed servers, creating a highly efficient, scalable,
    reliable system that is responsive and frequently updated.'

  zh: 以模块或微服务形式编写的应用程序提供了多项优势：组成服务可以独立演进或随着时间的推移替换为其他更可扩展或更优越的服务。此外，现代微服务模式在分离关注点和在服务之间设置合同方面做得更好，这使得检查和修复问题变得更加容易。这种将应用程序作为微服务编写、更新和部署的方法，这些微服务可以一起使用，但也可以独立更新、扩展和调试，是现代软件开发的精髓。在这本书中，我们将这种模式称为“现代”或“云原生”应用程序开发。术语*云原生*适用于此处，因为微服务模式非常适合在分布式基础设施或云上运行。微服务可以逐步推出、扩展、修订、替换、调度、重新调度，并在分布式服务器上紧密打包，从而创建一个高效、可扩展、可靠的系统，该系统响应迅速且经常更新。
- en: Modern applications can be written *greenfield* (from scratch) or refactored
    from existing *brownfield* applications by following a set of architectural and
    operational principles. The end goal of application modernization is typically
    revenue acceleration, and often this involves teams outside IT, in line-of-business
    (LOB) units. IT departments in most traditional enterprises have historically
    focused on reducing costs and optimizing operations. Although cost reduction and
    optimized operations can be by-products of application modernization, they are
    not the most important benefits. Of course, the modernization process itself requires
    up-front investment. Anthos is Google Cloud’s platform for application modernization
    in hybrid and multicloud environments. It provides the approach and technical
    foundation needed to attain high ROI application modernization. An IT strategy
    that emphasizes modularity through APIs, microservices, and cloud portability
    combined with a developer platform that automates reuse, experiments, and cost-efficient
    scaling along with secure, reliable operations are the basic critical prerequisites
    for successful application modernization.

  zh: 现代应用程序可以按照一系列架构和运营原则从头开始编写（*greenfield*）或通过重构现有的*brownfield*应用程序来实现。应用程序现代化的最终目标通常是加速收入，通常这涉及到IT部门之外的业务线（LOB）团队。大多数传统企业的IT部门在历史上一直专注于降低成本和优化运营。尽管降低成本和优化运营可能是应用程序现代化的副产品，但它们并不是最重要的好处。当然，现代化过程本身需要前期投资。Anthos是谷歌云在混合和多云环境中进行应用程序现代化的平台。它提供了实现高投资回报率应用程序现代化所需的方法和技术基础。强调通过API、微服务和云可移植性实现模块化的IT战略，结合一个能够自动化重用、实验和成本效益扩展以及安全可靠运营的开发者平台，是成功应用程序现代化的基本关键前提。
- en: One aspect of Anthos is a modern developer experience that accelerates line-of-business
    application development. It is optimized for refactoring brownfield apps and writing
    microservices and API-based applications. It offers unified local, on-prem, and
    cloud development with event-driven automation from source to production. Developers
    can write code rapidly using modern languages and frameworks with local emulation
    and testing and integrated CI/CD, and Anthos supports rapid iteration, experimentation,
    and advanced rollout strategies. The Anthos developer experience emphasizes cloud
    APIs, containers, and functions, but enterprise platform teams can also customize
    it. A key goal of the Anthos developer experience is for teams to release code
    multiple times a day, thereby enhancing both velocity and reliability. Anthos
    features built-in velocity and ROI metrics to help development teams measure and

  zh: Anthos的一个方面是现代开发者体验，它加速了业务线应用程序的开发。它针对重构棕色地带应用程序和编写基于微服务和API的应用程序进行了优化。它提供统一的本地、本地和云开发，从源到生产的自动化事件驱动。开发者可以使用现代语言和框架快速编写代码，并使用本地仿真和测试以及集成CI/CD，Anthos支持快速迭代、实验和高级部署策略。Anthos开发者体验强调云API、容器和函数，但企业平台团队也可以对其进行定制。Anthos开发者体验的一个关键目标是让团队每天多次发布代码，从而提高速度和可靠性。Anthos具有内置的速度和投资回报率指标，以帮助开发团队衡量和优化其性能。数据驱动的基准测试通过预先包装的最佳实践蓝图得到增强，团队可以部署这些蓝图以实现性能的下一个层次。
- en: Another aspect of Anthos is an operator experience for central IT. Anthos shines
    as the uniquely scalable, streamlined way to run operations across multiple clouds.
    This function is enabled by the remarkable foundation of technology invented and
    honed at Google over the past 20 years for running services with extremely high
    reliability on relatively low-cost infrastructure. This is achieved through the
    standardization of the infrastructure using a layer of abstraction comprising
    Kubernetes, Istio, Knative, and several other building blocks, along with Anthos-specific
    extensions and integrations for automated configuration, security, and operations.
    The operator experience on Anthos offers advanced security and policy controls,
    automated declarative configuration, highly scalable service visualization and
    operations, and automated resource and cost management. It features extensive
    automation, measurement and fault avoidance capabilities for high availability,
    secure service management across the cloud, and on-prem, edge, virtualized, and
    bare metal infrastructure.

  zh: Anthos的另一个方面是为中央IT提供的操作员体验。Anthos以其独特可扩展、简化的方式在多个云中运行操作而脱颖而出。这一功能得益于谷歌在过去20年发明和磨练的非凡技术基础，该技术基础在相对低成本的基础设施上运行具有极高可靠性的服务。这是通过使用由Kubernetes、Istio、Knative和其他构建块组成的抽象层标准化基础设施来实现的，以及Anthos特定的扩展和集成，用于自动化配置、安全和操作。Anthos的操作员体验提供高级安全性和策略控制、自动声明性配置、高度可扩展的服务可视化和操作，以及自动资源和成本管理。它具有广泛的自动化、测量和故障避免能力，用于高可用性、云、本地、边缘、虚拟化和裸机基础设施上的安全服务管理。
- en: Enterprise and small companies alike find that multicloud and edge is their
    new reality, either organically or through acquisitions. Regulations in many countries
    require proven ability to migrate applications between clouds and a demonstration
    of failure tolerance with support for sovereignty. Unregulated companies find
    multicloud necessary for providing developers’ choice and access to innovative
    services. Opportunities for running services and providing greater intelligence
    at the edge add further surfaces to the infrastructure footprint. Some IT organizations
    roll their own cross-cloud platform integrations, but this job gets harder every
    day. It is extremely difficult to build a cross-cloud platform in a scalable,
    maintainable way, and, more importantly, that approach detracts from precious
    developer time for product innovation.

    结果也显示，越来越多的企业正在投资于能够实现精英表现的工具和实践。
- en: Why do teams with higher development velocity have better business results?
    In general, higher velocity means that developers can experiment more and test
    more, so they come up with a better answer in the same amount of time. But another
    reason exists. Teams with higher velocity have usually made writing and deploying
    code an automated, low-effort process, which has the side effect of enabling more
    people to become developers, especially those who are more entrenched in the business
    versus the tooling. As a result, high-velocity developer teams have more LOB thinking
    and a greater understanding of end user needs. The combination of rapid experimentation
    and focus on users yields better business results. Anthos is the common substrate
    layer that runs across clouds to provide a common developer experience for accelerating
    application delivery.

  zh: 为什么开发速度较快的团队有更好的业务成果？一般来说，更高的速度意味着开发者可以进行更多的实验和测试，因此在相同的时间内可以提出更好的答案。但还有一个原因。开发速度较快的团队通常已经将编写和部署代码变成了一种自动化、低成本的流程，这附带的效果是使更多的人成为开发者，特别是那些在业务方面比在工具方面更根深蒂固的人。因此，高速度的开发者团队有更多的业务线思维和更深入的用户需求理解。快速实验和关注用户的结合产生了更好的业务成果。Anthos是跨云运行的共同基础层，为加速应用程序交付提供统一的开发者体验。

    kingdom day in and day out. Operations includes teams that provision, upgrade,
    manage, troubleshoot, and scale all aspects of services, infrastructure, and the
    cloud. Typically, networking, compute, storage, security, identity, asset management,
    billing, and reliability engineering are part of the operations team of an enterprise.
    Traditional IT teams have anywhere from 15%-30% of their staff in IT operations.
    This team is not always visibly engaged in new product introductions with the
    line of business, but it often lays the groundwork, selecting clouds, publishing
    service catalogs, and qualifying services for use by the business. Failing to
    invest in operations automation often means that this team become the bottleneck

- en: On the flip side, modernizing operations has a tremendous positive effect on
    velocity. Modern application development teams are typically supported by a very
    lean operations team, where 80%-plus of staff are employed in software development

    infrastructure with scaled, automated operations. This means operations are extremely
    streamlined and use extensive automation to bring new services online quickly.
    Perhaps the greatest value of Anthos is in automating operations at scale consistently
