    of graphs and machine learning. Had Alessandro worked for one of the Web giants
    distilling the knowledge of an army of PhDs working on special one-off systems,
    this would be an interesting book, but for the majority of us it would satisfy
    our curiosity rather than being a practical guide. Fortunately for us, while Alessandro
    does have a PhD, he works in the enterprise space and has deep empathy and understanding
    for the kinds of systems that enterprises build. The book reflects this: Alessandro
    ably addresses the kinds of practical design and implementation challenges that
    software engineers and data professionals building contemporary systems outside
    of the hyperscale Web giants must circumvent.'

    My wife and I were awaiting our first son, who was going to be delivered quite
    soon, so we had few chances to go out or take any refreshment in the awesomely
    fresh, clean water of Apulia. Under those conditions, you can get crazy with DIY
    (not my case), or you can keep your mind busy with something challenging. Because
    I’m not a great fan of Sudoku, I started working on a night and weekend project:

  zh: 2012年的夏天是我能记得的意大利南部最热的一个夏天。我和我的妻子正在等待我们第一个儿子的出生，他很快就要出生了，所以我们几乎没有机会外出或在阿普利亚那令人惊叹的新鲜、干净的水中享受任何清凉。在这种条件下，你可以因为DIY（在我这个情况下不是）而变得疯狂，或者你可以用一些具有挑战性的东西来保持你的大脑忙碌。因为我不是Sudoku的超级粉丝，所以我开始了一个夜间和周末的项目：尝试构建一个通用的推荐引擎，它可以服务于多个范围和场景，从小型简单的到复杂和结构化的用户-项目交互数据集，最终包括相关的上下文信息。
- en: 'This was the moment when graphs forcefully entered my life. Such a flexible
    data model allowed me to store in the same way not only the users’ purchases,
    but also all the corollary information (later formally defined as contextual information)
    together with the resulting recommendation model. At that time, Neo4j 1.x was
    recently released. Although it didn’t have Cypher or the other advanced query
    mechanisms it has now, it was stable enough for me to select it as the main graph
    database for my project. Adopting graphs helped me unblock the project, and after
    four months, I released the alpha version of reco4j: the first graph-powered recommendation

- en: It was the beginning of a true and passionate love story. For three years, I
    experimented on my own, trying to sell the reco4j idea here and there (not so
    successfully, to be honest) when I had a call with Michal Bachman, CEO of GraphAware.
    A few days later, I flew to London to sign my contract as the sixth employee of
    this small consultancy firm, which helped companies succeed in their graph projects.

    to build new services and improve existing ones with the help of graphs. Graphs
    were capable not only of solving classical problems—from basic search facilities
    to recommendation engines, from fraud detection to information retrieval—but also
    became prominent technology for improving and enhancing machine learning projects.

  zh: 虽然从头到尾阅读这本书可以最大化学习效果，但并不需要这样做。它可以作为参考，随时应对新挑战。对于这个领域的初学者，我建议从前三章开始，以清晰地理解关键概念，然后跳转到感兴趣的具体主题章节。如果你对某个特定主题或应用感兴趣，最好从你感兴趣部分的第1章开始：第4章为推荐，第8章为欺诈检测，第11章为自然语言处理。如果你是图和机器学习的专家，并且只寻找建议，你可以阅读你感兴趣的章节。每个章节都建议阅读其他章节中的材料。

    breaks and reworked indentation to accommodate the available page space in the
    book. In some cases, even this was not enough, and listings include line-continuation
    markers (➥). Additionally, comments in the source code have often been removed
    from the listings when the code is described in the text. Code annotations accompany
    many of the listings, highlighting important concepts.

  zh: 关于封面插图
- en: The image on the cover of *Graph-Powered Machine Learning* has been extracted
    from *Roman Tarantella Dancer with Tambourine and a Mandolin Player* (1865). The
    artist is Anton Romako (1832-1889), an Austrian nineteenth-century painter who
    fell in love with Italy during one of his travels, moved to Rome in 1857, and
    started painting portions of everyday life in Italy. The painting shows a tarantella
    dancer, dancing and playing a tambourine (together with a man playing a mandolin).
    The image was chosen as a tribute to the author’s own origins in southern Italy,
    specifically in south Apulia, where this is still a living tradition. The tarantella
    is a traditional dance where the performer simulates what happens after the bite
    of a locally common type of Lycosa tarantula spider, named “tarantula” (not to
    be confused with what is commonly known as a tarantula today). This spider was
    popularly believed to be highly venomous and its bite would cause a hysterical
    condition known as tarantism. The original form of this dance is disordered and
    free-flowing to simulate such a condition. Others believe the dance was invented
    because the continuous movements, by causing intense sweating, can help to expel
    the spider’s venom from the body.

  zh: 《图神经网络机器学习》封面上的图像是从《罗马塔兰泰拉舞者，手摇铃鼓和曼陀林演奏者》（1865）中提取的。艺术家是安东·罗马科（1832-1889），一位在旅行中爱上意大利的奥地利19世纪画家，1857年移居罗马，开始绘画意大利的日常生活片段。这幅画展示了一位塔兰泰拉舞者，她在跳舞的同时还在敲击手摇铃鼓（与一位演奏曼陀林的男子一起）。这幅图像被选为对作者自己在意大利南部的起源的致敬，特别是在南阿普利亚，那里这种舞蹈仍然是一种活的传统。塔兰泰拉是一种传统舞蹈，表演者模拟了被当地常见的狼蛛——被称为“塔兰图拉”（不要与今天普遍所知的塔兰图拉混淆）咬后的情况。这种蜘蛛被普遍认为毒性极强，其咬伤会导致一种被称为塔兰图拉病的歇斯底里症状。这种舞蹈的原始形式是无序且流畅的，以模拟这种状态。其他人认为，舞蹈的发明是因为连续的运动，通过引起大量出汗，可以帮助将蜘蛛的毒液从体内排出。
- en: Whatever the real origin of this dance might be, the music and rhythm are pleasant

    it today.
