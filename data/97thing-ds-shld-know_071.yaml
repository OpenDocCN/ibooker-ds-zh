- en: Data science likes to be quite meta sometimes. There is a push to use machine
    learning models to check the actions of data scientists or other machine learning
    models for ethics violations. The watchers are being watched by the machine learning
    model.

  zh: 数据科学有时候喜欢很元。有推动使用机器学习模型来检查数据科学家或其他机器学习模型是否存在伦理违规的趋势。看守者正在被机器学习模型监视。
- en: I’m often asked whether it’s really possible for a machine learning model to
    automatically check for ethics violations. This question usually comes from companies
    that are worried about the sheer number of queries and overall discovery that
    a data scientist needs to run. With data democratization, even more people will
    have access to the data, which means even more possible ethics violations. It
    will be virtually impossible for the management team or general counsel to review
    every single query.

  zh: 我经常被问到机器学习模型是否真的能够自动检查伦理违规。这个问题通常来自那些担心数据科学家需要运行的查询数量和总体发现的公司。随着数据民主化的推动，更多人将获得数据访问权限，这意味着更多的可能出现伦理违规。对于管理团队或总法律顾问来说，要审查每一个查询几乎是不可能的。
- en: In my opinion, it isn’t possible to rely on a machine learning model to find
    ethics violations. The people who write the machine learning model are the same
    ones the machine would be watching for potential violations. If they aren’t the
    ones who wrote it, they will have enough of a background to know how not to have
    their query be flagged as an ethics violation. The data scientists especially
    will be able to make educated guesses as to which algorithms are being used and
    will know what the weakness of each algorithm is.

  zh: 我认为，依靠机器学习模型来查找伦理违规是不可能的。编写机器学习模型的人与机器会监视潜在违规的人是同一个人。如果他们不是编写它的人，他们将有足够的背景知识，知道如何避免将其查询标记为伦理违规。特别是数据科学家将能够对使用的算法进行有根据的猜测，并且将知道每个算法的弱点在哪里。
- en: Despite all of this, the company’s exposure to ethics violations remains the
    same. Something has to be done. What can the company do?

  zh: 尽管如此，公司对伦理违规的曝光仍然相同。必须采取行动。公司能做些什么呢？
- en: Before a company can even attempt a manual or automatic check for ethics violations,
    it will need to centralize the code and queries so that they are logged in a single
    place. This is something that the data engineering team would need to put in place.
    Without a single place to log all queries and code execution, there will be too
    many one-off locations for checks to be run. That would enable the easy circumventing
    of logging when someone is really dead set on behaving unethically.

  zh: 在公司甚至尝试手动或自动检查伦理违规之前，公司需要将代码和查询集中化，以便它们被记录在一个地方。这是数据工程团队需要实施的事情。如果没有一个地方来记录所有查询和代码执行，将会有太多的临时位置可以运行检查。这将使得在某人确实下决心行事不道德时很容易绕过日志记录。
- en: Once all the queries and code execution are centralized, the management team
    and general counsel can start to look for violations. With SQL queries, the intent
    and results will be relatively straightforward to review.

  zh: 一旦所有查询和代码执行被集中，管理团队和总法律顾问可以开始寻找违规行为。通过SQL查询，意图和结果将相对容易进行审查。
- en: With code, the review process may be far more difficult and time consuming.
    This is because the management team and general counsel may not know how to read
    code. Even if they know how to code, the intent and results of the code may not
    be readily apparent—the code could even be obfuscated to hide the intent behind
    it. Also, the code itself may not be accessible or checked into source control
    so that the exact code that was run can be read.

  zh: 使用代码，审查过程可能会更加困难和耗时。这是因为管理团队和总法律顾问可能不知道如何阅读代码。即使他们懂得编码，代码的意图和结果可能不会立即显现出来——代码甚至可能会被混淆以隐藏其背后的意图。此外，代码本身可能无法访问或检入源代码控制，以便可以阅读运行的确切代码。
- en: I think the only viable solution is to hire good people, give them training
    on what is and isn’t acceptable to do with the company’s data, and do spot checks
    of their code and queries. Checking every piece of code simply isn’t a realistic
    approach. The two alternatives that avoid code checks are both untenable. One
    option is to never put the data into people’s hands for fear of ethics violations—at
    that point, why even have a data strategy? The other option is to implicitly trust
    everything that your people do and hope for the best. I think the best option
    lies somewhere in the middle.

  zh: 我认为   我认为唯一可行的解决方案是雇佣优秀的人员，对公司数据的使用规范进行培训，并对他们的代码和查询进行抽查。仅仅检查每一行代码显然不是现实的方法。避免代码检查的两种替代方案都不可行。一种选择是因为担心伦理问题而决定永远不将数据交给员工处理——那么，为何还要有数据战略呢？另一种选择是对员工的一切行为都默许并寄希望于最好的结果。我认为最佳选择在于两者之间的某个地方。
