    and R. In contrast to other introductions, I expect some familiarity in one language
    before introducing the other. In short, I expect that you’re carrying baggage.
    I’d like to advise you to leave your baggage at the door, but baggage is designed
    to be hauled around, so that’s kind of hard to do. Instead, let’s embrace your
    baggage! Recognize that Python and R operate quite differently and you may not
    always find a 1:1 translation. That’s ok!'

    ones. Once you have a good grasp of these elements, you have the tools to delve
    further on your own. My goal is to get you to that point. Thus, the following
    chapters are not thorough introductions to each language.
