&#13;
&#13;
<p>In general, <a data-primary="sources of data" data-see="data sources" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45143393070480"/><a data-primary="finding" data-secondary="data" data-see="data sources" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45143393069472"/>there are four main “sources” of data that you can turn to when you are trying to answer a question about the world. I put “sources” in quotes because these are really <em>types</em> of sources, not specific websites, databases, or even organizations. Instead, these represent the mechanisms that journalists, researchers, and other professionals use to collect data about the world in order to answer their questions.</p>&#13;

<h1>Data Repositories and APIs</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p>“Open data” access<a data-primary="data sources" data-secondary="API" data-see="API" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45143393065408"/><a data-primary="data sources" data-secondary="data repositories" data-type="indexterm" id="data-source-repo"/><a data-primary="API (application programming interface)" data-secondary="as data sources" data-secondary-sortas="data sources" data-type="indexterm" id="api-data-source"/><a data-primary="data repositories" data-type="indexterm" id="data-repo"/><a data-primary="repositories (data)" data-type="indexterm" id="repo-data-source"/> has increasingly become a feature of many governmental and scientific organizations, in an effort to improve transparency, accountability, and—especially in the scientific community—<em>reproducibility</em>. This means that many government agencies, nonprofit organizations, and scientific journals, for example, maintain websites where you can access structured data relevant to their work. For example, a simple web search for “nyc open data” or “baltimore open data” will bring you to those cities’ “open data” portals; a similar search for “johannesburg open data” will bring you first to the South African Cities Open Data Almanac (SCODA) website, but a few links down you’ll find more datasets from an organization called “DataFirst” as well as the South African Data Portal hosted at <a href="http://opendataforafrica.org"><em class="hyperlink">http://opendataforafrica.org</em></a>. All of these sites will have some data—though as we  discussed in <a data-type="xref" href="ch03.html#chapter3">Chapter 3</a>, the <em>quality</em> of that data—including its appropriateness for answering your particular question—can vary widely.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>APIs are another valuable source of data, as they can provide access to highly detailed and customized datasets that won’t show up in search engine results. This is because API data is part of what’s sometimes referred to as the “deep web”: data that is accessible <em>via</em> the web but only through specially constructed searches sent to particular URLs. For example, while a web search for “currently available citibikes, nyc” will eventually bring you to an interactive map where you can click on a Citi Bike station to see how many bikes are available, a query to Citi Bike API allows you to access information about the available bikes at <em>all</em> Citi Bike stations in New York City. Moreover, the API will return that data in a file reasonably well structured for analysis, unlike the interactive map or, for that matter, most web pages.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Data repositories and APIs are often a great way to access large quantities of structured data that is relatively clean and easy to use for data analysis. At the same time, however, these data sources come with a significant limitation: the company or agency that runs the portal or API has complete control over what data it contains. This mean that the data  may be out of date, incomplete, or insufficiently contextualized—or it may simply omit information that the data owner doesn’t want others to know. In other words, just because the data may be clean and “ready to use” does <em>not</em> mean that it is necessarily good-quality data. A critical evaluation of its quality is still essential.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>More often than not, however, <em>all</em> of the information you need to answer your chosen question won’t be accessible through one of the preceding types of interfaces, so you’ll need to look toward other <a data-primary="data sources" data-secondary="data repositories" data-startref="data-source-repo" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45143393051200"/><a data-primary="API (application programming interface)" data-secondary="as data sources" data-secondary-sortas="data sources" data-startref="api-data-source" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45143393049952"/><a data-primary="data repositories" data-startref="data-repo" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45143393048400"/><a data-primary="repositories (data)" data-startref="repo-data-source" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45143393047456"/>sources.</p>&#13;

<h1>Subject Matter Experts</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p>As <a data-primary="data sources" data-secondary="subject matter experts" data-type="indexterm" id="data-source-sme"/><a data-primary="subject matter experts, as data source" data-type="indexterm" id="sme-data-source"/>discussed in <a data-type="xref" href="ch03.html#chapter3">Chapter 3</a>, <em>all</em> data originates with humans in one way or another. Yet it can often seem easier, at the outset, to rely on automated interfaces like the web portals and APIs discussed previously. True, those resources are almost constantly available; there’s no need to worry about telephone wait times, business hours, or vacation schedules when structuring an API call. At the same time, talking with human subject matter experts is often the fastest way to identify, if not obtain, the richest and most relevant data for answering your question. That’s because many publicly available data sources, even if they are web accessible, are niche enough so that while you may not yet know the best search terms to find them, specialists will use them on a regular basis. As such, they’ll not only be able to point you to portals and APIs that you would almost never be able to turn up in a web search, but they can also help you distinguish among seemingly similar data sources and provide important contextual information about their contents. Moreover, they may be able to voluntarily provide you with datasets that you might otherwise wait weeks or months for in response to a FOIA/L request.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>In general, there are three places you’ll find subject matter experts who may be able to help you locate or understand data. Colleges and universities are home to a dizzying array of experts on a seemingly infinite range of subjects. Start with a call or email to the public relations department, or just start reading the online profiles of faculty and researchers. Similarly, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), such as nonprofits and think tanks, employ experts according to their focus who may similarly be familiar with specialized datasets that would otherwise be difficult to discover; they may also have data to share that they have personally collected and/or analyzed. Finally, government employees can be an extraordinary source of data and insight, since they are often the very individuals required to collect and process it on behalf of the government in the first place. And while negative stereotypes abound, in my experience, government workers are among the most kindest and most generous data “helpers” you’ll <a data-primary="data sources" data-secondary="subject matter experts" data-startref="data-source-sme" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45143392893648"/><a data-primary="subject matter experts, as data source" data-startref="sme-data-source" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45143392892400"/>find.</p>&#13;

<section data-pdf-bookmark="FOIA/L Requests" data-type="sect1"><div class="sect1" id="foia_requests">&#13;
<h1>FOIA/L Requests</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) <a data-primary="data sources" data-secondary="FOIA/L requests" data-type="indexterm" id="data-source-foia"/><a data-primary="FOIA (Freedom of Information Act) requests" data-type="indexterm" id="foia"/><a data-primary="FOIL (Freedom of Information Law)" data-type="indexterm" id="foil"/>and Freedom of Information Law (FOIL) requests are a mechanism by which any individual can request records about government activities at the federal, state, or local level, respectively,<sup><a data-type="noteref" href="app03.html#idm45143392885712" id="idm45143392885712-marker">1</a></sup> which can be a source for data that is not already available through existing portals or publications. These requests are essentially a specialized letter that you can send to a designated office or individual within an agency, specifying your request for information.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>A key requirement for using FOIA/L requests effectively is to be as specific and narrow as possible: while FOIA/L laws guarantee your right to <em>request</em> data, most only mandate that you receive <em>a</em> response within a specified time frame (often between 5 and 20 business days); they do <em>not</em> require that the response include the data you requested. In most cases, an initial response will (1) deny your request based on <a href="https://dhs.gov/foia-exemptions">allowable exemptions and exclusions</a>; (2) acknowledge your request but classify it as “complex,” thereby warranting an extended timeline for delivery; or (3) respond that a search request was performed but yielded no results. Successfully obtaining the data you seek will likely require at least one “appeal”—and lots and lots of patience.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>A comprehensive introduction to FOIA/L requests is beyond the scope of this book, but there are a number of guides available online that provide templates and tips on how to construct your FOIA/L request, and even websites like MuckRock that provide tools to help you write, submit, and keep track of requests that you have submitted. In thinking about what to ask for, keep in mind the following:</p>&#13;
<dl>&#13;
<dt>FOIA/L requests only apply to government records</dt>&#13;
<dd>&#13;
<p>You’ll need to think creatively about how the phenomenon you’re interested in might generate such records. Think about any activities related to your question that may require permits, licensing, or taxation—all of these will generate government records. Also keep in mind that the activities of government employees—including their emails, calendars, and other records—are subject to FOIA/L laws as well.</p>&#13;
</dd>&#13;
<dt>Don’t “bundle” requests</dt>&#13;
<dd>&#13;
<p>If you are looking for records containing multiple terms, send a separate FOIA/L request for each term and file type (e.g., email, calendar etc.). This increases the number of FOIA/L requests you have to track but also reduces the chances that your request will be delayed because it has been classified as “complex.”</p>&#13;
</dd>&#13;
<dt>Use publicly accessible forms</dt>&#13;
<dd>&#13;
<p>If you don’t know what information an agency collects, use publicly accessible forms—such as those required for tax, licensing, and permitting purposes—to get an idea. You can then refer to those specific form numbers and fields in your request.</p>&#13;
</dd>&#13;
<dt>Look at past requests</dt>&#13;
<dd>&#13;
<p>FOIA/L requests are themselves subject to these laws. If you are looking for information that was part of a previously filled request, referring to it might expedite your own.</p>&#13;
</dd>&#13;
<dt>Politely reach out to the relevant personnel</dt>&#13;
<dd>&#13;
<p>FOIA/L officers can help you on your way—or make things difficult. Try to develop a cordial, if not friendly, relationship with them—either via email or telephone. They can offer you crucial tips on how to refine your request for greater <a data-primary="data sources" data-secondary="FOIA/L requests" data-startref="data-source-foia" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45143392872208"/><a data-primary="FOIA (Freedom of Information Act) requests" data-startref="foia" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45143392870960"/><a data-primary="FOIL (Freedom of Information Law)" data-startref="foil" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45143392869920"/>success.</p>&#13;

<h1>Custom Data Collection</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Sometimes, <a data-primary="data sources" data-secondary="custom data collection" data-type="indexterm" id="data-source-custom"/><a data-primary="custom data collection" data-type="indexterm" id="custom-data-collect"/>your question just cannot be answered with any combination of existing datasets, no matter how many experts or APIs you use. This circumstance highlights the very human-constructed nature of data: it only exists because someone somewhere has decided to collect it, clean it, and make it available. If your question is especially timely or unique, it may turn out that that person is you.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>At universities, you can find multiple courses dedicated entirely to various methods of data collection, from surveys to sensors. The method(s) you choose when collecting data will depend on both the nature of your question and the resources (including time) that you have to devote to the data-gathering process. If you are seeking exploratory or anecdotal data, then your data collection process might be as simple as posting a question or “poll” on social media and analyzing the responses you receive. If, on the other hand, you want to be able to make claims that <em>generalize</em>—that is, claims about a larger phenomenon than precisely the ones you have data for—then your data must be <em>representative</em>, as we discussed in <a data-type="xref" href="ch03.html#chapter3">Chapter 3</a>.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Whichever type of data you’re collecting—anecdotal or representative—there are two main methods for doing so: interviews and instrumentation. Interview techniques involve asking humans to provide a response, whether those responses are open-ended, multiple choice, or some other format. Instrumentation techniques involve some degree of automated data collection, whether of web-browsing habits or carbon monoxide levels. In either case, you’ll need to read up on best practices or consult with experts in order to understand both the limitations of your measurement techniques and the appropriate methods for analyzing and interpreting your data. While collecting your own data can be a challenge, it can also be incredibly <a data-primary="data sources" data-secondary="custom data collection" data-startref="data-source-custom" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45143392860640"/><a data-primary="custom data collection" data-startref="custom-data-collect" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45143392859392"/>rewarding.</p>&#13;
