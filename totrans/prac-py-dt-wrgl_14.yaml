- en: In general, there are four main “sources” of data that you can turn to when
    you are trying to answer a question about the world. I put “sources” in quotes
    because these are really *types* of sources, not specific websites, databases,
    or even organizations. Instead, these represent the mechanisms that journalists,
    researchers, and other professionals use to collect data about the world in order
    to answer their questions.

- en: “Open data” access has increasingly become a feature of many governmental and
    scientific organizations, in an effort to improve transparency, accountability,
    and—especially in the scientific community—*reproducibility*. This means that
    many government agencies, nonprofit organizations, and scientific journals, for
    example, maintain websites where you can access structured data relevant to their
    work. For example, a simple web search for “nyc open data” or “baltimore open
    data” will bring you to those cities’ “open data” portals; a similar search for
    “johannesburg open data” will bring you first to the South African Cities Open
    Data Almanac (SCODA) website, but a few links down you’ll find more datasets from
    an organization called “DataFirst” as well as the South African Data Portal hosted
    at [*http://opendataforafrica.org*](http://opendataforafrica.org). All of these
    sites will have some data—though as we discussed in [Chapter 3](ch03.html#chapter3),
    the *quality* of that data—including its appropriateness for answering your particular
    question—can vary widely.

    detailed and customized datasets that won’t show up in search engine results.
    This is because API data is part of what’s sometimes referred to as the “deep
    web”: data that is accessible *via* the web but only through specially constructed
    searches sent to particular URLs. For example, while a web search for “currently
    available citibikes, nyc” will eventually bring you to an interactive map where
    you can click on a Citi Bike station to see how many bikes are available, a query
    to Citi Bike API allows you to access information about the available bikes at
    *all* Citi Bike stations in New York City. Moreover, the API will return that
    data in a file reasonably well structured for analysis, unlike the interactive
    map or, for that matter, most web pages.'

    of structured data that is relatively clean and easy to use for data analysis.
    At the same time, however, these data sources come with a significant limitation:
    the company or agency that runs the portal or API has complete control over what
    data it contains. This mean that the data may be out of date, incomplete, or insufficiently
    contextualized—or it may simply omit information that the data owner doesn’t want
    others to know. In other words, just because the data may be clean and “ready
    to use” does *not* mean that it is necessarily good-quality data. A critical evaluation
    of its quality is still essential.'

- en: As discussed in [Chapter 3](ch03.html#chapter3), *all* data originates with
    humans in one way or another. Yet it can often seem easier, at the outset, to
    rely on automated interfaces like the web portals and APIs discussed previously.
    True, those resources are almost constantly available; there’s no need to worry
    about telephone wait times, business hours, or vacation schedules when structuring
    an API call. At the same time, talking with human subject matter experts is often
    the fastest way to identify, if not obtain, the richest and most relevant data
    for answering your question. That’s because many publicly available data sources,
    even if they are web accessible, are niche enough so that while you may not yet
    know the best search terms to find them, specialists will use them on a regular
    basis. As such, they’ll not only be able to point you to portals and APIs that
    you would almost never be able to turn up in a web search, but they can also help
    you distinguish among seemingly similar data sources and provide important contextual
    information about their contents. Moreover, they may be able to voluntarily provide
    you with datasets that you might otherwise wait weeks or months for in response
    to a FOIA/L request.

    be able to help you locate or understand data. Colleges and universities are home
    to a dizzying array of experts on a seemingly infinite range of subjects. Start
    with a call or email to the public relations department, or just start reading
    the online profiles of faculty and researchers. Similarly, nongovernmental organizations
    (NGOs), such as nonprofits and think tanks, employ experts according to their
    focus who may similarly be familiar with specialized datasets that would otherwise
    be difficult to discover; they may also have data to share that they have personally
    collected and/or analyzed. Finally, government employees can be an extraordinary
    source of data and insight, since they are often the very individuals required
    to collect and process it on behalf of the government in the first place. And
    while negative stereotypes abound, in my experience, government workers are among
    the most kindest and most generous data “helpers” you’ll find.

    are a mechanism by which any individual can request records about government activities
    at the federal, state, or local level, respectively,^([1](app03.html#idm45143392885712))
    which can be a source for data that is not already available through existing
    portals or publications. These requests are essentially a specialized letter that
    you can send to a designated office or individual within an agency, specifying
    your request for information.

    and narrow as possible: while FOIA/L laws guarantee your right to *request* data,
    most only mandate that you receive *a* response within a specified time frame
    (often between 5 and 20 business days); they do *not* require that the response
    include the data you requested. In most cases, an initial response will (1) deny
    your request based on [allowable exemptions and exclusions](https://dhs.gov/foia-exemptions);
    (2) acknowledge your request but classify it as “complex,” thereby warranting
    an extended timeline for delivery; or (3) respond that a search request was performed
    but yielded no results. Successfully obtaining the data you seek will likely require
    at least one “appeal”—and lots and lots of patience.'

    methods of data collection, from surveys to sensors. The method(s) you choose
    when collecting data will depend on both the nature of your question and the resources
    (including time) that you have to devote to the data-gathering process. If you
    are seeking exploratory or anecdotal data, then your data collection process might
    be as simple as posting a question or “poll” on social media and analyzing the
    responses you receive. If, on the other hand, you want to be able to make claims
    that *generalize*—that is, claims about a larger phenomenon than precisely the
    ones you have data for—then your data must be *representative*, as we discussed
    in [Chapter 3](ch03.html#chapter3).

    degree of automated data collection, whether of web-browsing habits or carbon

    with experts in order to understand both the limitations of your measurement techniques
