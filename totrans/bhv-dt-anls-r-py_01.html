<h1><span class="label">Part I. </span>Understanding Behaviors</h1>
<p>In this first part of the book, I’ll explain why behavioral data analysis requires a new approach.</p>
<p><a data-type="xref" href="ch01.xhtml#the_causal_behavioral_framework_for_da">Chapter 1</a> will describe that new approach, the causal-behavioral framework for data analysis. We’ll look at a concrete example showing how even the simplest of data analyses can be derailed by the presence of a confounder. Solving that issue is at best complicated and at worst impossible with traditional approaches, but the new framework provides a straightforward process.</p>
<p><a data-type="xref" href="ch02.xhtml#understanding_behavioral_data">Chapter 2</a> will explore further the specificities of behavioral data while providing both a gentle introduction to behavioral science and a process for ensuring that our data adequately reflects the corresponding real-life behaviors.</p>
