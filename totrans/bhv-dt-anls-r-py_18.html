	<p>Cohen, Jacob. <em>Statistical Power Analysis for the Behavioral Sciences</em>, 2nd Edition. Abingdon, UK: Routledge, 2013. A classic on power analysis. Like most classics, it is somewhat dated on computer implementation, but still a great resource to think more deeply about what statistical power is.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Cunningham, Scott. <em>Causal Inference: The Mixtape</em>. New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 2021. A very accessible variation on the Angrist/Pischke books, still targeted primarily to academics.</p>

	<p>Efron, Bradley, and R. J. Tibshirani. <em>An Introduction to the Bootstrap</em>. Abingdon, UK: Chapman and Hall/CRC, 1994. Efron is the “inventor” of the Bootstrap, and this book provides a good introduction to it, for people with at least an undergrad understanding of math and statistics.</p>

	<p>Funder, David C. <em>The Personality Puzzle</em>. New York: W. W. Norton &amp; Company, 2016. A great “advanced introduction” to personality psychology that bridges the gap between pop science and academic research.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Gelman, Andrew, and Jennifer Hill. <em>Data Analysis Using Regression and Multilevel/Hierarchical Model</em>. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, 2006. Provides a deeper analysis of multilevel (i.e., clustered) data, at the cost of a higher threshold for mathematical and statistical knowledge.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Gerber, Alan S., and Donald P. Green. <em>Field Experiments: Design, Analysis and Interpretation</em>. New York: W. W. Norton &amp; Company, 2012. My go-to book for a deeper perspective on experimental design. It contains a lot of statistical and mathematical formulas but these should be understandable by anyone with even a moderate quantitative background. My recommended resource if you want to analyze experimental data with statistical tests.</p>

	<p>Glennerster, Rachel, and Kudzai Takavarasha. <em>Running Randomized Evaluations: A Practical Guide</em>. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2013. An accessible introduction to experimentation in the context of development economics and aid. Contains extensive discussions of the empirical challenges of running experiments in the real world (i.e., not online).</p>

	<p>Jose, Paul E. <em>Doing Statistical Mediation &amp; Moderation</em>. New York: Guilford Press, 2013. A useful complement to Hayes (2017), even though it’s more focused on academic research and uses more arcane software (that is, arcane outside of academia and related fields!).</p>

Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, 2016. You’re not a biologist? Neither am I. This book has still helped deepen my understanding of causal diagrams, and with the limited number of books on the topic, beggars can’t be choosers.</p>

A very accessible presentation by the author of the mice package for R, with a lot of concrete examples.

	<p>VanderWeele, Tyler. <em>Explanation in Causal Inference: Methods for Mediation and Interaction</em>. Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press, 2015. An excellent bridge between the causal analysis literature and the social sciences’ literature on mediation and moderation. Covers a significant amount of more advanced material not found in the other references.</p>

	<p>Wilcox, Rand R. <em>Fundamentals of Modern Statistical Methods: Substantially Improving Power and Accuracy</em>, 2nd Edition. New York: Springer, 2010. We routinely assume that our data is normally distributed “enough.” Wilcox shows that this is unwarranted and can severely bias analyses. A very readable book on an advanced topic.</p>
