- en: Max Weber (1930) argued that the Protestant ethic, especially the variants of
    Calvinism are more aligned with capitalism than the Catholicism. Weber (1930)
    observed that Protestant regions in Northern Europe were more developed than the
    Catholic regions in the Southern Europe. He hypothesized that Protestants work
    harder, save more, rely more on themselves, and expect less from the Government.
    All characteristics that would lead to a greater economic prosperity.

    is a confound factor. Historically, Protestants have higher level of literacy,
    because they were incentivized to read the Bible.

    likely to become Protestant. Religion is a choice variable. People self-select
    the ideology that confirms their own view of the world.

    institutionally and geographically homogeneous. In 1536, the canton of Vaud didn’t
    self-select to become Protestant, but it was forced because of a war. Therefore,
    this is a quasi-experiment setting, where treatment region and control region
    are similar to each other, because of a historical event.
