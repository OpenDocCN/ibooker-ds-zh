    presumably by someone who has never visited a fire station. Nonetheless, data
    science is a hot and growing field, and it doesn’t take a great deal of sleuthing
    to find analysts breathlessly prognosticating that over the next 10 years, we’ll
    need billions and billions more data scientists than we currently have.

- en: Although I originally intended to write a book covering all three, I quickly
    realized that a thorough treatment of “substantive expertise” would require tens
    of thousands of pages. At that point, I decided to focus on the first two. My
    goal is to help you develop the hacking skills that you’ll need to get started
    doing data science. And my goal is to help you get comfortable with the mathematics
    and statistics that are at the core of data science.

- en: This is a somewhat heavy aspiration for a book. The best way to learn hacking
    skills is by hacking on things. By reading this book, you will get a good understanding
    of the way I hack on things, which may not necessarily be the best way for you
    to hack on things. You will get a good understanding of some of the tools I use,
    which will not necessarily be the best tools for you to use. You will get a good
    understanding of the way I approach data problems, which may not necessarily be
    the best way for you to approach data problems. The intent (and the hope) is that
    my examples will inspire you to try things your own way. All the code and data
    from the book is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/joelgrus/data-science-from-scratch)
    to get you started.

- en: Similarly, the best way to learn mathematics is by doing mathematics. This is
    emphatically not a math book, and for the most part, we won’t be “doing mathematics.”
    However, you can’t really do data science without *some* understanding of probability
    and statistics and linear algebra. This means that, where appropriate, we will
    dive into mathematical equations, mathematical intuition, mathematical axioms,
    and cartoon versions of big mathematical ideas. I hope that you won’t be afraid
    to dive in with me.

    fun, because, well, playing with data is fun! (Especially compared to some of
    the alternatives, like tax preparation or coal mining.)

- en: There are lots and lots of data science libraries, frameworks, modules, and
    toolkits that efficiently implement the most common (as well as the least common)
    data science algorithms and techniques. If you become a data scientist, you will
    become intimately familiar with NumPy, with scikit-learn, with pandas, and with
    a panoply of other libraries. They are great for doing data science. But they
    are also a good way to start doing data science without actually understanding
    data science.

- en: In this book, we will be approaching data science from scratch. That means we’ll
    be building tools and implementing algorithms by hand in order to better understand
    them. I put a lot of thought into creating implementations and examples that are
    clear, well commented, and readable. In most cases, the tools we build will be
    illuminating but impractical. They will work well on small toy datasets but fall
    over on “web-scale” ones.

    techniques to larger datasets. But we won’t be using them here.

    Many people believe it’s the statistical programming language R. (We call those
    people *wrong*.) A few people suggest Java or Scala. However, in my opinion, Python
    is the obvious choice.

    languages I find more pleasant, better designed, or just more fun to code in.
    And yet pretty much every time I start a new data science project, I end up using
    Python. Every time I need to quickly prototype something that just works, I end
    up using Python. And every time I want to demonstrate data science concepts in
    a clear, easy-to-understand way, I end up using Python. Accordingly, this book
    uses Python.

- en: The goal of this book is not to teach you Python. (Although it is nearly certain
    that by reading this book you will learn some Python.) I’ll take you through a
    chapter-long crash course that highlights the features that are most important
    for our purposes, but if you know nothing about programming in Python (or about
    programming at all), then you might want to supplement this book with some sort
    of “Python for Beginners” tutorial.

    into detail where going into detail seems crucial or illuminating, at other times
    leaving details for you to figure out yourself (or look up on Wikipedia).

- en: Over the years, I’ve trained a number of data scientists. While not all of them
    have gone on to become world-changing data ninja rockstars, I’ve left them all
    better data scientists than I found them. And I’ve grown to believe that anyone
    who has some amount of mathematical aptitude and some amount of programming skill
    has the necessary raw materials to do data science. All she needs is an inquisitive
    mind, a willingness to work hard, and this book. Hence this book.
