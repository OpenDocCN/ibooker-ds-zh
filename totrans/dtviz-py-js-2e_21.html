<h1><span class="label">Chapter 15. </span>Imagining a Nobel Visualization</h1>
<p>In <a data-type="xref" href="ch13.xhtml#chapter_delivery_restful">Chapter 13</a>, we explored <a data-primary="imagining a visualization (Nobel Prize dataset)" data-type="indexterm" id="ix_imagnviz"/>the Nobel Prize dataset, looking for interesting stories to tell based on aspects of the data that should engage and educate. We found some interesting nuggets, among them:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Maria Goeppert, the only female physicist other than Marie Curie to win a Physics Nobel</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The post-WWII surge of American Nobel prizes, passing the declining tallies of the three biggest European winners: the UK, Germany, and France</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The difference in continental prize distributions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The dominance of the Scandinavian countries when prize tallies are adjusted for population size</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These and a number of other narratives require particular types of visualization. Comparison of Nobel Prize numbers by nation is probably best achieved by means of a conventional bar chart, whereas geographic prize distributions demand a map. In this chapter, we will try to design a modern, interactive visualization that incorporates some of the key stories we discovered while exploring the dataset.</p>
<section data-pdf-bookmark="Who Is It For?" data-type="sect1"><div class="sect1" id="idm45607751427728">
<h1>Who Is It For?</h1>
<p>The first consideration when imagining a <a data-primary="imagining a visualization (Nobel Prize dataset)" data-secondary="identifying the audience" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45607751426336"/>visualization is its target audience. A visualization intended for display in a gallery or museum will likely be very different from one intended for an in-house dashboard, even though they could use the same dataset. The Nobel Prize visualization anticipated for this book has as its chief constraint that it teach a key subset of D3 and the JavaScript needed to create a modern interactive web visualization. It is a fairly informal dataviz and should entertain and inform. It does not require a specialist audience.</p>
</div></section>
<section data-pdf-bookmark="Choosing Visual Elements" data-type="sect1"><div class="sect1" id="idm45607751424912">
<h1>Choosing Visual Elements</h1>
<p>The first constraint on our Nobel Prize visualization is that it be simple enough to teach and provide a set of the key D3 skills.<a data-primary="imagining a visualization (Nobel Prize dataset)" data-secondary="visual elements, choosing" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45607751423472"/><a data-primary="visual elements, choosing" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45607751422496"/> But even if that constraint was not in place, it is probably sensible to limit the scope of any visualization. This scope depends very much on the context,<sup><a data-type="noteref" href="ch15.xhtml#idm45607751421728" id="idm45607751421728-marker">1</a></sup> but, as in many learning contexts, less is often more. Too much interactivity risks overwhelming the user and diluting the impact of any stories we might wish to tell.</p>
<p>With this in mind, let’s look at the key elements we want to include and how these are to be visually arranged.</p>
<p>A menu bar of some sort is a must, allowing the user to engage with the visualization and manipulate the data.<a data-primary="menu bar" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45607751420016"/> Its functionality will depend on the stories we choose to tell, but it will certainly provide some way to explore or filter the dataset.</p>
<p>Ideally, the visualization should display each prize by year and this display should update itself as the user refines the data through the menu bar. Given that national and regional trends are of interest, a map should be included, highlighting the prize-winning countries selected and giving some indication of their tally. A bar chart is the best way to compare the number of prizes by country, and this too should adapt dynamically to any data changes. There should also be a choice of measuring the absolute number of prizes by country or per capita, taking into account the respective population sizes.</p>
<p>In order to personalize the visualization, we should be able to select individual winners, showing any available picture and the short biography we scraped from Wikipedia. This requires a list of currently selected winners and a window in which to display the selected individual.</p>
<p>The aforementioned elements provide enough scope to tell the key stories we discovered in the last chapter, and with a bit of finessing should fit into a standard form factor.<sup><a data-type="noteref" href="ch15.xhtml#idm45607751417968" id="idm45607751417968-marker">2</a></sup></p>
<p>Our Nobel Prize visualization uses a fixed size for all devices, which means compromising larger devices with higher resolutions in order to accommodate smaller ones, such as last-generation smartphones or tablets.<a data-primary="fixed size for visualizations" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45607751416672"/> I find that for a lot of visualization work, a fixed size gives you much-needed control over specific placement of visual content blocks, information boxes, labels, and so on. For some visualizations, particularly multielement dashboards, a different approach may be required. <a href="https://oreil.ly/AURTe">Responsive web design (RWD)</a> attempts to adapt the look and feel of your visualization to optimize for the specific device. Some popular CSS libraries such as <a href="https://getbootstrap.com">Bootstrap</a> detect the device size (e.g., a tablet with resolution of 1,280×800 pixels) and change the stylesheet applied in order to get the most out of the available screen real estate. <a data-primary="Bootstrap library (CSS)" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45607751414592"/><a data-primary="CSS" data-secondary="Bootstrap library, detecting device size" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45607751413888"/><a data-primary="responsive web design (RWD)" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45607751412912"/><a data-primary="RWD (responsive web design)" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45607751412272"/>Specifying a fixed size for your visualization and using absolute positioning within it is the way to go if you require pinpoint control of the placement of your visual elements. However, you should be aware of the challenges of RWD, particularly when required to build multicomponent dashboards and the like.</p>
<p>Now let’s aim to pin down the look, feel, and requirements of the individual elements of our Nobel Prize visualization, beginning with the main user control, the menu bar.</p>
</div></section>
<section data-pdf-bookmark="Menu Bar" data-type="sect1"><div class="sect1" id="idm45607751411120">
<h1>Menu Bar</h1>
<p>An interactive visualization is driven by the user selecting from options, clicking on things, manipulating sliders, and so on.<a data-primary="imagining a visualization (Nobel Prize dataset)" data-secondary="menu bar" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45607751409616"/><a data-primary="menu bar" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45607751408608"/> These allow the user to define the scope of the visualization, which is why we’ll deal with them first. Our user controls will appear as a toolbar at the top of the visualization.</p>
<p>A standard way to drive interesting discoveries is to allow the user to filter the data in key dimensions. <a data-primary="filtering data" data-secondary="user filtering data in key dimensions" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45607751407296"/>The obvious options for our Nobel Prize visualization are category, gender, and country, the focus of our exploration in the last chapter.  These filters should be cumulative, so, for example, selecting gender female and category Physics should return the two winning female physicists. In addition to those filters, we should have a radio button to choose between absolute and per capita numbers of national prize winners.</p>
<p><a data-type="xref" href="#imagine_ui">Figure 15-1</a> shows a menu bar that meets our requirements. Placed at the top of our visualization, it has selectors to filter our required dimensions and a radio button to select our national winner metric, either absolute or per capita.</p>
<figure><div class="figure" id="imagine_ui">
<img alt="dpj2 1501" height="158" src="assets/dpj2_1501.png" width="938"/>
<h6><span class="label">Figure 15-1. </span>The user’s controls</h6>
</div></figure>
<p>The menu bar will sit atop the key component of our visualization, a chart showing all the Nobel Prizes over time. Let’s describe that next.</p>
</div></section>
<section data-pdf-bookmark="Prizes by Year" data-type="sect1"><div class="sect1" id="idm45607751402624">
<h1>Prizes by Year</h1>
<p>The last chapter showed a lot of interesting historical trends in the Nobel Prizes by country. <a data-primary="imagining a visualization (Nobel Prize dataset)" data-secondary="prizes by year" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45607751401008"/><a data-primary="timeline, Nobel Prize winners by year" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45607751400000"/>We also saw that although female recipients have increased recently, they are way behind in the sciences. One way of allowing these trends to be discovered is to show all the Nobel Prizes on a timeline and provide a filter to select the prizes by gender, country, and category (using the menu bar just discussed).</p>
<p>If we make our visualization 1,000 pixels wide, then, with 114 years of prizes to cover, we are allowed around 8 pixels per prize, enough to differentiate them. The highest number of prizes awarded in any one year is 14, in the year 2000, giving a minimal height for this element of 8×14 pixels, around 120. A circle, color-coded by category, seems a good way to represent the individual prizes, giving us a chart something like the one shown in <a data-type="xref" href="#imagine_timeline">Figure 15-2</a>.</p>
<figure><div class="figure" id="imagine_timeline">

<h6><span class="label">Figure 15-2. </span>A timeline of Nobel Prizes by year, color-coded by <span class="keep-together">category</span></h6>
</div></figure>
<p>The individual prizes are the essence of the visualization, so we’ll place this timeline prominently at the top above our
central element, which should be a map, reflecting the international nature of the prize and allowing the user to see any global trends.</p>
</div></section>
<section data-pdf-bookmark="A Map Showing Selected Nobel Countries" data-type="sect1"><div class="sect1" id="idm45607751394944">
<h1>A Map Showing Selected Nobel Countries</h1>
<p>Mapping is one of D3’s strengths, with many <a data-primary="map showing selected Nobel countries" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45607751393408"/><a data-primary="imagining a visualization (Nobel Prize dataset)" data-secondary="map showing selected countries of winners" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45607751392736"/>global projections available, from the classic Mercator to 3D spherical presentations.<sup><a data-type="noteref" href="ch15.xhtml#idm45607751391536" id="idm45607751391536-marker">3</a></sup> Though maps are obviously engaging, they are also often overused and inappropriate when presenting nongeographical data. For example, unless you’re careful, large geographical areas, such as countries in Europe or states of the US, tend to outweigh smaller ones even when the latter have far larger populations. When you are presenting demographic information, this skew is hard to avoid and misrepresentation can result.<sup><a data-type="noteref" href="ch15.xhtml#idm45607751388656" id="idm45607751388656-marker">4</a></sup></p>
<p>But the Nobel Prize is an international one and the distribution of prizes by continent is of interest, making a global map a good way to depict the filtered data. If we superimpose a filled circle at the center of each country to reflect the prize measure (absolute or per capita), then we avoid skewing in favor of the larger land masses. In Europe, with many relatively small countries by land mass, these circles will intersect. By making them slightly transparent,<sup><a data-type="noteref" href="ch15.xhtml#idm45607751386960" id="idm45607751386960-marker">5</a></sup> we can still see the superimposed circles and, by adding the opacities, give a sense of prize density. <a data-type="xref" href="#imagine_map">Figure 15-3</a> demonstrates this.</p>

</div></figure>
<p>We’ll provide a little tooltip for the map, both<a data-primary="tooltips" data-secondary="for Nobel Prize map" data-secondary-sortas="Nobel" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45607751381616"/> as a way of demonstrating how to build this handy visual component and also to help a little with naming the countries. <a data-type="xref" href="#imag_tooltip">Figure 15-4</a> shows what we’re aiming for.</p>

<p>The last of the larger elements will be placed below the map: a bar chart allowing the user to make clear comparisons of the number of Nobel Prizes by country.</p>

<section data-pdf-bookmark="A Bar Chart Showing Number of Winners by Country" data-type="sect1"><div class="sect1" id="idm45607751376768">
<h1>A Bar Chart Showing Number of Winners by Country</h1>
<p>There is a lot of evidence
that bar charts are great for making numeric comparisons.<sup><a data-type="noteref" href="ch15.xhtml#idm45607751375056" id="idm45607751375056-marker">6</a></sup> A <a data-primary="bar charts" data-secondary="showing number of Nobel Prize winners by country" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45607751373584"/><a data-primary="imagining a visualization (Nobel Prize dataset)" data-secondary="bar chart showing winners by country" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45607751372480"/>reconfigurable bar chart gives our visualization a lot of flexibility, allowing it to present the results of user-directed data filtering, choice of metric (i.e., absolute versus per capita counts), and more.</p>
<p><a data-type="xref" href="#imagine_bar">Figure 15-5</a> shows the bar chart we’ll use to compare the prize hauls of chosen countries. Both the axes ticks and bars should respond dynamically to user interaction, driven by the menu bar (see <a data-type="xref" href="#imagine_ui">Figure 15-1</a>). <a data-primary="animated transitions in data visualizations" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45607751369296"/><a data-primary="transitions" data-secondary="animated, in data visualizations" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45607751368560"/>An animated transition between bar chart states would be good and (as we’ll see in <a data-type="xref" href="ch17.xhtml#sect_transitions">“Transitions”</a>) pretty much comes free with D3. As well as being attractive, there’s reason to think such transitions are also effective communicators. See this <a href="https://stanford.io/1Ue3cBR">Stanford University paper</a> on the effectiveness of animated transitions in data visualization for some insights.</p>
