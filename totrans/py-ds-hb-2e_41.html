<p><a data-primary="machine learning" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45858744774656"/><a data-primary="Scikit-Learn package" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45858744773952"/>This final part is an introduction to the very broad topic of machine
learning, mainly via Python’s
<a href="http://scikit-learn.org">Scikit-Learn package</a>. You can think of machine
learning as a class of algorithms that allow a program to detect
particular patterns in a dataset, and thus “learn” from the data to
draw inferences from it. This is not meant to be a comprehensive
introduction to the field of machine learning; that is a large subject
and necessitates a more technical approach than we take here. Nor is it
meant to be a comprehensive manual for the use of the Scikit-Learn
package (for this, you can refer to the resources listed in
<a data-type="xref" href="ch50.xhtml#section-0515-learning-more">“Further Machine Learning Resources”</a>).
Rather, the goals here are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>To introduce the fundamental vocabulary and concepts of machine
learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To introduce the Scikit-Learn API and show some examples of its use</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To take a deeper dive into the details of several of the more
important classical machine learning approaches, and develop an
intuition into how they work and when and where they are applicable</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Much of this material is drawn from the Scikit-Learn tutorials and
workshops I have given on several occasions at PyCon, SciPy, PyData, and
other conferences. Any clarity in the following pages is likely due to
the many workshop participants and co-instructors who have given me
valuable feedback on this material over the years!</p>
