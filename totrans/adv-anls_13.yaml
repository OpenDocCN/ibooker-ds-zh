- en: Created in 1991 by Guido van Rossum, Python is a programming language that,
    like R, is free and open source. At the time, van Rossum was reading the scripts
    from *Monty Python’s Flying Circus* and decided to name the language after the
    British comedy. Unlike R, which was designed explicitly for data analysis, Python
    was developed as a general-purpose language meant to do things like interact with
    operating systems, handle processing errors, and so forth. This has some important
    implications for how Python “thinks” and works with data. For example, you saw
    in [Chapter 7](ch07.html#data-structures-in-r) that R has a built-in tabular data
    structure. This isn’t the case in Python; we’ll need to rely more heavily on external
    packages to work with data.

    languages not just for analytics but for computing generally.'

    and is the suggested installation for this book. It’s maintained by a for-profit
    company of the same name and is available in paid tiers; we’ll be using the free
    Individual Edition. Python is now on its third version, Python 3\. You can download

    S program for EDA. Because of the iterative nature of EDA, the expected workflow
    of the language is to execute and explore the output of selected lines of code.
    This makes it easy to conduct data analysis directly from an R script, *.r*. We
    used the RStudio IDE to provide additional support for our programming session,
    such as dedicated panes for help documentation and information about the objects
    in our environment.

    languages, where code needs first to be compiled into a machine-readable file,
    and *then* run. This can make it relatively trickier to conduct piecemeal data
    analysis from a Python script, *.py*. This pain point of working with Python for
    statistical and, more broadly, scientific computing caught the attention of physicist
    and software developer Fernando Pérez, who with colleagues in 2001 launched the
    IPython project to make a more interactive interpreter for Python (IPython as
    a playful shorthand for “interactive Python”). One result of this initiative was
    a new type of file, the *IPython Notebook*, denoted with the *.ipynb* file extension.

    Project Jupyter, a language-agnostic initiative to develop interactive, open source
    computing software. Thus, the IPython Notebook became the Jupyter Notebook while
    retaining the *.ipynb* extension. Jupyter notebooks run as interactive web applications
    that allow users to combine code with text, equations, and more to create media-rich
    interactive documents. In fact, Jupyter was named in part as an homage to the
    notebooks Galileo used to record his discovery of the planet Jupiter’s moons.
    A *kernel* is used behind the scenes to execute the notebook’s code. By downloading
    Anaconda, you’ve set up all these necessary parts to execute Python from a Jupyter

- en: The Python Standard Library includes a module `random` containing a function
    `randint()`. This function works like `RANDBETWEEN()` in Excel; for example, `randint(1,
    6)` will return an integer between 1 and 6\. Use this function to find a random
    number between 0 and 36.

  zh: Python标准库包括一个名为`random`的模块，其中包含一个名为`randint()`的函数。这个函数的用法类似于Excel中的`RANDBETWEEN()`；例如，`randint(1,
    6)`会返回一个介于1和6之间的整数。使用这个函数找到一个介于0和36之间的随机数。

- en: I will again encourage you to begin using the language as soon as possible in
    your everyday work, even if at first it’s just as a calculator. You can also try
    performing the same tasks in R *and* Python, then comparing and contrasting. If
    you learned by relating R to Excel, the same will work for relating Python to
    R.

  zh: 我再次鼓励你尽快在日常工作中开始使用这种语言，即使一开始只是作为计算器。你也可以尝试在R和Python中执行相同的任务，然后进行比较和对比。如果你是通过将R与Excel相关联来学习的，那么将Python与R相关联也是一样的道理。
