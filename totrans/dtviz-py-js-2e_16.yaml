- en: In this part of the book, we’ll see how to deliver our select Nobel Prize dataset,
    recently cleaned and explored, to the browser, wherein JavaScript and D3 will
    turn it into an engaging, interactive visualization (see [Figure IV-1](#toolchain_delivery)).

- en: The great thing about using a general-purpose library like Python is that you
    can as easily roll a web server in a few, impressively succinct lines, as mine
    your data with powerful data-processing libraries.

- en: The key server tool in our toolchain is Flask, Python’s powerful but lightweight
    web framework. In [Chapter 12](ch12.xhtml#chapter_delivery_intro), we’ll see how
    to serve your data statically (serving system files) and dynamically, usually
    as a database selection specified in the request. In [Chapter 13](ch13.xhtml#chapter_delivery_restful),
    we’ll see how two Flask-based libraries make creating a RESTful web API the work
    of a few lines of Python.
