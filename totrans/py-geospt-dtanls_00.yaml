- en: '*Python for Geospatial Data Analysis* is an introduction to geospatial data
    analysis using a selection of Python libraries and packages, optimized for exploration
    and discovery. In recent years, as the Internet of Things has arisen and location
    data has become available on local computers, professionals in a wide range of
    fields have been exploring geospatial platforms with built-in analytics—geospatial
    professionals, data scientists, business analysts, geographers, geologists, researchers,
    analysts, computer scientists, and statistics professionals, to name just a few.
    As they explore, these learners often seek to gain a deeper appreciation of the
    technology embedded in their tools. Graphical user interfaces are powerful, but
    you can truly elevate your skill set by writing your own Python code to fully
    customize or automate the outcome and by gaining a better grasp of how large platforms
    and systems work.'

    in most industries likely have access to location data and publicly available
    datasets. Advances in cloud computing no longer require massive downloads to local
    computers, meaning that access has been democratized to anyone with an internet-enabled
    device. This book aims to be a resource that meets professionals wherever they
    are and serves as a guide to their goals and understanding. This book encourages
    readers of all backgrounds to engage in geospatial analysis to help inform decision
    making in urban planning, climate change research, and many other fields.

    a bit of Python and can jump in and out of QGIS or ArcGIS without really needing
    to know operationalized workflows. You can certainly work with embedded systems
    without appreciating raster, vector, or mathematical models, but understanding
    these foundational elements will bring a new level of rigor and inquiry to your
    exploratory and explanatory data competency.

    I had a problem to solve. In conducting analysis on electronic health records,
    I found that they incorporated plenty of medical data but only vaguely useful
    demographic information. Examining this aspect of the built infrastructure of
    health care revealed to me the importance of location in predicting health outcomes.
    We can’t make policy decisions about public health without knowing the answers
    to questions like:'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Python is a popular, nimble scripting language. Its accessible coding syntax
    makes it easier to learn than most programming languages, so you can start using
    it relatively quickly. Python is great for geospatial data analysis because it
    has already been incorporated into many geographic information system (GIS) applications,
    including ArcGIS and QGIS. It also has the support of a vibrant open source community
    with an abundance of libraries and packages.

- en: This is *not* a Python 101 book. If you’re a beginner looking for a basic grounding
    in the language, there are many resources available to you. You might want to
    start with *Pandas 1.x Cookbook,* second edition, by Matt Harrison and Theodore
    Petrou (Packt Publishing), or any of the in-person or online courses by Dunder
    Data, such as [*Master the Fundamentals of Python*](https://oreil.ly/swed0)*.*

- en: Perhaps you don’t have the inclination or time to learn an entire programming
    language. Although I recommend having at least one computer language in your toolbox,
    that’s OK. The purpose of this book is to get you up and running with the extensive
    ecosystem of publicly available geospatial data, and total programming competence
    is not required. I provide step-by-step guidance along with the code snippets
    throughout the book. I direct you to resources on a variety of additional functions
    not covered in this book so that you can take what you learn and use it to explore.
    As you become comfortable working with one or two functions in a large library
    or package, you will gain confidence to expand into new areas.

    freely by the developers and usually incorporates contributions from community
    members. Most make use of Python. To the best of my ability, I’ve ensured that
    this book features resources available without burdensome subscription services.
    Any costs, however modest, are highlighted so that you can make informed decisions.
    My focus on open source doesn’t mean that I don’t support enterprise solutions;
    it means I want to lower the barriers to conducting meaningful analysis around
    big questions.'

    of datasets, some of which you perhaps don’t have access to in your current professional
    role. *Python for Geospatial Data Analysis* is not linear like typical books about
    technology (or, for that matter, about Python). There are multiple ways to explore
    data problems. Perhaps you can draw inspiration from working in an integrated
    development environment (IDE) for the first time. Maybe you’re curious about working
    in a terminal or console.

    or library in a single book. If you’re familiar with a particular tool or library,
    you probably have favorite features that I haven’t included here. That’s fine—I
    just want to give you a feel for each one. From there, you can continue discovering
    what they have to offer.

    how do you write a book for newly minted geospatial professionals who know Python
    *and* for newly minted Python programmers who are well versed in geospatial analytics?
    I decided simply to make it interesting. My goal isn’t to grant you professional
    expertise at either end of the spectrum but to bring us all together to learn
    tools and best practices.'

    enough to go out and explore geospatial analytics on your own. To that end, as
    I teach each tool and technique, I ask you to follow along, installing the tools
    as needed and using a Jupyter or Google Colab notebook to run code. But I don’t
    want you to stop there, so I also provide a host of different experiences that
    invite you to continue to explore.

    the noise that often comes with it. [Chapter 9](ch09.xhtml#exploring_the_geospatial_data_abstracti)

    Library (GDAL). Finally, in [Chapter 10](ch10.xhtml#using_python_to_measure_climate_data),

    your geospatial analytics skills can be in researching a pressing global issue:
