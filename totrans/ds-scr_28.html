<p>Where do you go from here?&#13;
Assuming I haven’t scared you off of data science,&#13;
there are a number of things you should learn next.</p>&#13;

<p>I<a data-primary="IPython shell" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45635703400488"/> mentioned <a href="http://ipython.org/">IPython</a> earlier in the book.&#13;
It provides a shell with far&#13;
more functionality than the standard Python shell, and it&#13;
adds “magic functions” that allow you to&#13;
(among other things)&#13;
easily copy and paste code&#13;
(which is normally complicated by the combination of blank lines and whitespace formatting)&#13;
and run scripts from within the shell.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Mastering IPython will make your life far easier.&#13;
(Even learning just a little bit of IPython will make your life a lot easier.)</p>&#13;
<div data-type="note" epub:type="note"><h6>Note</h6>&#13;
<p>In<a data-primary="Jupyter notebook" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45635703397016"/> the first edition, I also recommended that you learn about&#13;
the IPython (now Jupyter) Notebook, a computational environment&#13;
that allows you to combine text, live Python code, and visualizations.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>I’ve since <a href="https://twitter.com/joelgrus/status/1033035196428378113">become a notebook skeptic</a>,&#13;
as I find that they confuse beginners and encourage bad coding practices.&#13;
(I have many other reasons too.) You will surely receive plenty of encouragement&#13;
to use them from people who aren’t me, so just remember that I’m the dissenting voice.</p>&#13;

<p>Throughout this book, we dabbled in linear algebra (<a data-type="xref" href="ch04.html#linear_algebra">Chapter 4</a>), statistics (<a data-type="xref" href="ch05.html#statistics">Chapter 5</a>), probability (<a data-type="xref" href="ch06.html#probability">Chapter 6</a>), and various aspects of machine learning.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>To be a good data scientist, you should know much more about these topics, and I encourage you to give each of them a more in-depth study,&#13;
using the textbooks recommended at the ends of the chapters,&#13;
your own preferred textbooks,&#13;
online courses,&#13;

<h1>Not from Scratch</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Implementing<a data-primary="data science" data-secondary="learning “from scratch”" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45635703388232"/> things “from scratch” is great for understanding how they work.&#13;
But it’s generally not great for performance&#13;
(unless you’re implementing them specifically with performance in mind),&#13;
ease of use, rapid prototyping, or error handling.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>In practice, you’ll want to use well-designed libraries&#13;
that solidly implement the fundamentals.  My original proposal for&#13;
this book involved a second “now let’s learn the libraries” half&#13;
that O’Reilly, thankfully, vetoed. Since the first edition came out,&#13;
Jake VanderPlas has written the <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920034919.do"><em>Python Data Science Handbook</em></a> (O’Reilly), which is a good introduction to the relevant libraries&#13;
and would be a good book for you to read next.</p>&#13;

It features arrays that perform better than our <code>list</code>-vectors,&#13;
matrices that perform better than our <code>list</code>-of-<code>list</code>-matrices,&#13;
and lots of numeric functions for working with them.</p>&#13;

data structures for working with datasets in Python.&#13;
Its primary abstraction is the <code>DataFrame</code>,&#13;
which is conceptually similar to the NotQuiteABase <code>Table</code> class&#13;
we constructed in <a data-type="xref" href="ch24.html#databases">Chapter 24</a>, but with&#13;
much more functionality and better performance.</p>&#13;

<p><a href="http://scikit-learn.org">scikit-learn</a> is<a data-primary="scikit-learn" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45635703372584"/> probably the&#13;
most popular library for doing machine learning in Python.&#13;
It contains all the models we’ve implemented&#13;
and many more that we haven’t.  On a real problem,&#13;
you’d never build a decision tree from scratch;&#13;
you’d let scikit-learn do the heavy lifting.&#13;
On a real problem, you’d never write an optimization&#13;
algorithm by hand; you’d count on scikit-learn to already be using a really good one.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Its documentation contains <a href="http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/">many, many examples</a>&#13;
of what it can do (and, more generally, what machine learning can do).</p>&#13;

&#13;
<p>The<a data-primary="data visualization" data-secondary="resources for learning about" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45635703368232"/> matplotlib charts we’ve been creating&#13;
have been clean and functional but not particularly&#13;
stylish (and not at all interactive).  If you want&#13;
to get deeper into data visualization,&#13;
you have several options.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>The first is to further explore matplotlib,&#13;
only a handful of whose features we’ve actually covered.&#13;
Its website contains many <a href="http://matplotlib.org/examples/">examples</a>&#13;
of its functionality and a <a href="http://matplotlib.org/gallery.html">gallery</a>&#13;
of some of the more interesting ones.  If you want to create&#13;
static visualizations (say, for printing in a book), this is probably&#13;
your best next step.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>You<a data-primary="data visualization" data-secondary="tools for" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45635703364232"/><a data-primary="seaborn" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45635703363224"/> should also check out <a href="https://seaborn.pydata.org/">seaborn</a>,&#13;
which is a library that (among other things) makes matplotlib more attractive.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>If you’d<a data-primary="interactive visualizations" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45635703361080"/> like to create <em>interactive</em> visualizations that you can&#13;
share on the web, the<a data-primary="D3.js library" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45635703359784"/> obvious choice is probably <a href="http://d3js.org">D3.js</a>,&#13;
a JavaScript library for creating “data-driven documents” (those are the three Ds).&#13;
Even if you don’t know much JavaScript, it’s often possible to crib examples from&#13;
the <a href="https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Gallery">D3 gallery</a> and tweak them to&#13;
work with your data. (Good data scientists copy from the D3 gallery;&#13;
great data scientists <em>steal</em> from the D3 gallery.)</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Even if you have no interest in D3, just browsing the gallery&#13;
is itself a pretty incredible education in data visualization.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p><a href="http://bokeh.pydata.org">Bokeh</a> is a<a data-primary="Bokeh library" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45635703355336"/> project that brings D3-style functionality&#13;
into Python.</p>&#13;

<p>You can be a data scientist without doing deep learning,&#13;

&#13;
<p>The<a data-primary="deep learning" data-secondary="tools for" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45635703347976"/> two most popular deep learning frameworks for Python are&#13;
<a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/">TensorFlow</a> (created by Google)&#13;
and <a href="https://pytorch.org/">PyTorch</a> (created by Facebook).&#13;
The internet is full of tutorials for them&#13;
that range from wonderful to awful.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>TensorFlow<a data-primary="TensorFlow" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45635703344872"/><a data-primary="PyTorch" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45635703344136"/> is older and more widely used, but PyTorch is&#13;
(in my opinion) much easier to use and (in particular) much&#13;
more beginner-friendly. I prefer (and recommend) PyTorch,&#13;
but—as they say—no one ever got fired for choosing TensorFlow.</p>&#13;

<p>If<a data-primary="data" data-secondary="collecting" data-tertiary="sources for" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45635703341576"/> you’re doing data science as part of your job,&#13;
you’ll most likely get the data as part of your job&#13;
(although not necessarily).  What if you’re doing&#13;
data science for fun?  Data is everywhere, but here are&#13;
some starting points:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<ul>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p><a href="http://www.data.gov">Data.gov</a> is the<a data-primary="Data.gov" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45635703338040"/> government’s open data portal.&#13;
If you want data on anything that has to do with the government&#13;
(which seems to be most things these days), it’s a good place to start.</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p>Reddit has a couple of forums, <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/datasets">r/datasets</a> and <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/data">r/data</a>, that are places to both ask for and discover data.</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p>Amazon.com maintains a collection of <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/public-data-sets/">public datasets</a>&#13;
that they’d like you to analyze using their products (but that you can analyze&#13;
with whatever products you want).</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p>Robb Seaton has a quirky list of curated datasets <a href="http://rs.io/100-interesting-data-sets-for-statistics/">on his blog</a>.</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;

<p><a href="https://www.kaggle.com/">Kaggle</a> is<a data-primary="Kaggle" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45635703329656"/> a site that holds data science competitions.&#13;
I never managed to get into it (I don’t have much of a competitive nature when it comes to data science),&#13;
but you might. They host a lot of datasets.</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p>Google<a data-primary="Dataset Search" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45635703327752"/> has a newish <a href="https://toolbox.google.com/datasetsearch">Dataset Search</a>&#13;

&#13;
<p>Accordingly, several years ago, I set out to build a&#13;
<a href="https://github.com/joelgrus/hackernews">Hacker News story classifier</a>&#13;
to predict whether I would or would not be interested in any given story. This did not go over so well with the users of Hacker News, who resented the idea that someone might not be interested in every story on the site.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>This involved hand-labeling a lot of stories (in order to have a training set),&#13;
choosing story features (for example, words in the title, and domains&#13;
of the links), and training a Naive Bayes classifier not unlike our spam filter.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>For reasons now lost to history, I built it in Ruby.  Learn from my mistakes.</p>&#13;

<p>Luckily (from a data perspective), they maintain a&#13;
<a href="http://www2.seattle.gov/fire/realtime911/getDatePubTab.asp">Real-Time 911 site</a>&#13;
that lists every fire alarm along with the fire trucks involved.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>And so, to indulge my interest, I scraped many years’ worth of fire alarm data&#13;
and performed a <a href="https://github.com/joelgrus/fire">social network analysis</a>&#13;
of the fire trucks.  Among other things, this required me to invent a&#13;

&#13;
<p>In particular, it felt clear to me that there was a distinct difference between the shirts marketed to toddler boys and toddler girls. And so I asked myself if I could train a model to recognize these differences.</p>&#13;

<p>Spoiler: <a href="https://github.com/joelgrus/shirts">I could</a>.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>This involved downloading the images of hundreds of shirts,&#13;
shrinking them all to the same size,&#13;
turning them into vectors of pixel colors,&#13;
and using logistic regression to build a classifier.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>One approach looked simply at which colors were present in each shirt;&#13;
a second found the first 10 principal components of the shirt image&#13;
vectors and classified each shirt using its projections into&#13;
the 10-dimensional space spanned by the “eigenshirts” (<a data-type="xref" href="#eigenshirt">Figure 27-1</a>).</p>&#13;
