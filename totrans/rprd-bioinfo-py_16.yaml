- en: In the chapters in this part, I’ll show you several programs I’ve written that
    capture patterns I have used repeatedly in bioinformatics. First, I’ll show you
    how to write a program to find basic statistics from sequence files and format
    an output table. Next, I’ll demonstrate how to select sequences using pattern
    matching on the header information followed by a program that will create artificial
    DNA sequences using data learned from training files. Then I’ll show you a program
    that explores randomness to subsample sequences, and I’ll finish by using Python
    to parse delimited text files both with and without header information. I hope
    you’ll find patterns in these programs you can use when writing your own.
