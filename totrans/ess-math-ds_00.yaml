- en: In the past 10 years or so, there has been a growing interest in applying math
    and statistics to our everyday work and lives. Why is that? Does it have to do
    with the accelerated interest in “data science,” which Harvard Business Review
    called [“the Sexiest Job of the 21st Century”](https://oreil.ly/GslO6)? Or is
    it the promise of machine learning and “artificial intelligence” changing our
    lives? Is it because news headlines are inundated with studies, polls, and research
    findings but unsure how to scrutinize such claims? Or is it the promise of “self-driving”
    cars and robots automating jobs in the near future?
  prefs: []

- en: I will make the argument that the disciplines of math and statistics have captured
    mainstream interest because of the growing availability of data, and we need math,
    statistics, and machine learning to make sense of it. Yes, we do have scientific
    tools, machine learning, and other automations that call to us like sirens. We
    blindly trust these “black boxes,” devices, and softwares; we do not understand
    them but we use them anyway.

- en: While it is easy to believe computers are smarter than we are (and this idea
    is frequently marketed), the reality cannot be more the opposite. This disconnect
    can be precarious on so many levels. Do you really want an algorithm or AI performing
    criminal sentencing or driving a vehicle, but nobody including the developer can
    explain why it came to a specific decision? Explainability is the next frontier
    of statistical computing and AI. This can begin only when we open up the black
    box and uncover the math.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You may also ask how can a developer not know how their own algorithm works?
    We will talk about that in the second half of the book when we discuss machine
    learning techniques and emphasize why we need to understand the math behind the
    black boxes we build.

- en: To another point, the reason data is being collected on a massive scale is largely
    due to connected devices and their presence in our everyday lives. We no longer
    solely use the internet on a desktop or laptop computer. We now take it with us
    in our smartphones, cars, and household devices. This has subtly enabled a transition
    over the past two decades. Data has now evolved from an operational tool to something
    that is collected and analyzed for less-defined objectives. A smartwatch is constantly
    collecting data on our heart rate, breathing, walking distance, and other markers.
    Then it uploads that data to a cloud to be analyzed alongside other users. Our
    driving habits are being collected by computerized cars and being used by manufacturers
    to collect data and enable self-driving vehicles. Even “smart toothbrushes” are
    finding their way into drugstores, which track brushing habits and store that
    data in a cloud. Whether smart toothbrush data is useful and essential is another
    discussion!

- en: All of this data collection is permeating every corner of our lives. It can
    be overwhelming, and a whole book can be written on privacy concerns and ethics.
    But this availability of data also creates opportunities to leverage math and
    statistics in new ways and create more exposure outside academic environments.
    We can learn more about the human experience, improve product design and application,
    and optimize commercial strategies. If you understand the ideas presented in this
    book, you will be able to unlock the value held in our data-hoarding infrastructure.
    This does not imply that data and statistical tools are a silver bullet to solve
    all the world’s problems, but they have given us new tools that we can use. Sometimes
    it is just as valuable to recognize certain data projects as rabbit holes and
    realize efforts are better spent elsewhere.

- en: This growing availability of data has made way for data science and machine
    learning to become in-demand professions. We define essential math as an exposure
    to probability, linear algebra, statistics, and machine learning. If you are seeking
    a career in data science, machine learning, or engineering, these topics are necessary.
    I will throw in just enough college math, calculus, and statistics necessary to
    better understand what goes in the black box libraries you will encounter.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With this book, I aim to expose readers to different mathematical, statistical,
    and machine learning areas that will be applicable to real-world problems. The
    first four chapters cover foundational math concepts including practical calculus,
    probability, linear algebra, and statistics. The last three chapters will segue
    into machine learning. The ultimate purpose of teaching machine learning is to
    integrate everything we learn and demonstrate practical insights in using machine
    learning and statistical libraries beyond a black box understanding.

    programming background, this is the book to grab. As someone who started programming
    with Java, I have a deep appreciation for how Deepak shares Python features and
    relates them to Java developers. If you have done .NET, C++, or other C-like languages
    you will probably learn Python effectively from this book as well.

- en: This book will not make you an expert or give you PhD knowledge. I do my best
    to avoid mathematical expressions full of Greek symbols and instead strive to
    use plain English in its place. But what this book will do is make you more comfortable
    talking about math and statistics, giving you *essential* knowledge to navigate
    these areas successfully. I believe the widest path to success is not having deep,
    specialized knowledge in one topic, but instead having exposure and practical
    knowledge across several topics. That is the goal of this book, and you will learn
    just enough to be dangerous and ask those once-elusive critical questions.

    to thank my wife Kimberly for her support while I wrote this book, especially
    as we raised our son, Wyatt, to his first birthday. Kimberly is an amazing wife
    and mother, and everything I do now is for my son and our family’s better future.

    never throw in the towel. Given this book’s topic, I’m glad they encouraged me
    to take calculus seriously in high school and college, and nobody can write a
    book without regularly exiting their comfort zone.

    to open doors since I wrote my first book on SQL in 2015\. Jill and Jess have

    grateful that Jess thought of me when this topic came up.

    Safety and Security program. To have been given the opportunity to pioneer concepts

    Arch, you continue to amaze me and I worry the world will stop functioning the
    day you retire.

    who are partners in my venture, Yawman Flight. Bootstrapping a startup is hard,
    and their help has allowed precious bandwidth to write this book. Jon brought
    me onboard at USC and his tireless accomplishments in the aviation journalism
    world are nothing short of remarkable (look him up!). It is an honor that they
    are as passionate as I am about an invention I started in my garage, and I don’t
    think I could bring it to the world without them.
