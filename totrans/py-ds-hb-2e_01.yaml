    asked which one I use in my own work. My answer sometimes surprises people: my
    preferred environment is [IPython](http://ipython.org) plus a text editor (in
    my case, Emacs or VSCode depending on my mood). Jupyter got its start as the IPython
    shell, which was created in 2001 by Fernando Perez as an enhanced Python interpreter
    and has since grown into a project aiming to provide, in Perez’s words, “Tools
    for the entire life cycle of research computing.” If Python is the engine of our
    data science task, you might think of Jupyter as the interactive control panel.'

- en: 'As well as being a useful interactive interface to Python, Jupyter also provides
    a number of useful syntactic additions to the language; we’ll cover the most useful
    of these additions here. Perhaps the most familiar interface provided by the Jupyter
    project is the Jupyter Notebook, a browser-based environment that is useful for
    development, collaboration, sharing, and even publication of data science results.
    As an example of the usefulness of the notebook format, look no further than the
    page you are reading: the entire manuscript for this book was composed as a set
    of Jupyter notebooks.'

- en: This part of the book will start by stepping through some of the Jupyter and
    IPython features that are useful to the practice of data science, focusing especially
    on the syntax they offer beyond the standard features of Python. Next, we will
    go into a bit more depth on some of the more useful *magic commands* that can
    speed up common tasks in creating and using data science code. Finally, we will
    touch on some of the features of the notebook that make it useful for understanding
    data and sharing results.
