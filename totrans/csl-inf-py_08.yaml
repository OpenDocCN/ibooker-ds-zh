- en: In the Netherlands, there are legal prostitution zones that in Dutch is called
    tippelzones. Bisschop et al. (2017) reported that the opening of a tippelzone
    reduces sexual abuse and rape by about 30-40%.

    tippelzones. Average household income (“inkhh”) measured in 1,000 euros is similar
    in the 3 groups. Tippelzones cities also have individuals with a higher level
    of education. The proportion of immigrants is higher in big cities (11.4%). The
    share of social insurance benefits (“insurWWAO_pc”) is similar to the 3 groups.

    In the other columns, the coefficients of tippelzone are not statistically significant.
    It looks that legalizing prostitution decreases sexual abuse, but not other crimes
    as rape, assault, illegal weapon, and drug-related.

    the regulation of prostitution and crime.” In the discussion section, Bisschop

    system is correlated with a short-run decrease of 30-40 percent in sexual abuse
    and rape, and the results are robust to different specifications.” Why do Bisschop
    et al. (2017) use the word “causal” in the introduction and “correlated” in the
