&#13;
&#13;
<p>In the <a data-type="xref" href="preface01.html#preface">Preface</a>, I stated the following learning objective:</p>&#13;
<blockquote>&#13;
<p>By the end of this book, you should be able to <em>conduct exploratory data analysis and hypothesis testing using a programming language</em>.</p></blockquote>&#13;
&#13;
<p>I sincerely hope you feel this objective has been met, and that you are confident to advance into further areas of analytics. To end this leg of your analytics journey, I’d like to share some topics to help round out and expand upon what you now know.</p>&#13;

<h1>Research Design and Business Experiments</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p>You learned in <a data-type="xref" href="ch03.html#foundations-of-inference">Chapter 3</a> that sound data analysis can only follow from <a data-primary="data collection concerns" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46274526797592"/><a data-primary="collecting data" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46274526796904"/>sound data <em>collection</em>: as the saying goes, “garbage in, garbage out.” In this book, we’ve assumed our data was collected accurately, was the right data for our analysis, and contained a representative sample. And we’ve been working with well-known datasets often taken from peer-reviewed research, so this is a safe assumption.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>But often you can’t be so sure about your data; you may responsible for collecting <em>and</em> analyzing it. It’s worth <a data-primary="research design and methods" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46274526794296"/>learning more, then, about research <em>design</em> and <em>methods</em>. This field can get quite sophisticated and academic, but it’s found practical applications in the field of business experiments. <a data-primary="data analytics" data-secondary="further reading on" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46274526792472"/>Check out Stefan H. Thomke’s <em>Experimentation Works: The Surprising Power of Business Experiments</em> (Harvard Business Review Press) for an overview of how and why to apply sound research methods to business.</p>&#13;

<p><a data-type="xref" href="ch05.html#data-analytics-stack">Chapter 5</a> reviewed the differences between statistics, data analytics, and data science and concluded that although there are differences in methods, more unites these fields than divides them.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>If you are keenly interested in <a data-primary="data science" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46274526752376"/><a data-primary="machine learning" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46274526751672"/><a data-primary="Python programming language" data-secondary="further reading on" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46274526751000"/><a data-primary="R programming language" data-secondary="further reading on" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46274526749992"/>data science and machine learning, focus your learning efforts on R and Python, with some SQL and database knowledge too.

<section data-pdf-bookmark="Version Control" data-type="sect1"><div class="sect1" id="idm46274526746232">&#13;
<h1>Version Control</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p><a data-type="xref" href="ch05.html#data-analytics-stack">Chapter 5</a> also mentioned the importance of <a data-primary="reproducible workflows" data-secondary="and version control systems" data-secondary-sortas="version control systems" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46274526744024"/><a data-primary="version control systems" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46274526742744"/>reproducibility. Let’s look at a key application in that fight. You’ve likely run into a set of files like the following before:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<ul>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p><em>proposal.txt</em></p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p><em>proposal-v2.txt</em></p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p><em>proposal-Feb23.txt</em></p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p><em>proposal-final.txt</em></p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p><em>proposal-FINAL-final.txt</em></p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Maybe one user created <em>proposal-v2.txt</em>; another started <em>proposal-Feb23.txt</em>. Then there’s the difference between <em>proposal-final.txt</em> and <em>proposal-FINAL-final.txt</em> to contend with. It can be quite difficult to sort out which is the “main” copy, and how to reconstruct and migrate all changes to that copy while keeping a record of who contributed what.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>A <em>version control system</em> can come to the rescue here. This is a way to track projects over time, such as the contributions and changes made by different users. Version control is a game changer for collaboration and tracking revisions but has a relatively steep learning curve.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Git is a <a data-primary="Git version control system" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46274526732024"/>dominant version control system that is quite popular among data scientists, software engineers, and other technical professionals. In particular, they often use the cloud-based hosting service GitHub to manage Git projects. For an overview of Git and GitHub, check out <a class="orm:hideurl" href="https://oreil.ly/SV0Xq"><em>Version Control with Git</em></a>, 2nd edition by Jon Loeliger and Matthew McCullough (O’Reilly). For a look at how to pair Git and GitHub with R and RStudio, check out the online resource <a href="https://happygitwithr.com"><em>Happy Git and GitHub for the useR</em></a> by Jenny Bryan et al. At this time Git &#13;
<span class="keep-together">and other</span> version control systems are relatively uncommon in data analytics workflows, but they are growing in popularity due in part to the growing demand for &#13;
<span class="keep-together">reproducibility</span>.</p>&#13;

&#13;
<p>From recording and collecting it to analyzing and modeling it, data is surrounded by <a data-primary="data analytics" data-secondary="ethical concerns with" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46274526725832"/><a data-primary="ethics and data analytics" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46274526724856"/>ethical concerns. In <a data-type="xref" href="ch03.html#foundations-of-inference">Chapter 3</a> you learned about statistical bias: especially in a <a data-primary="machine learning" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46274526723176"/>machine learning context, it’s possible that a model could begin to discriminate against groups of people in unjust or illegal ways. If data is being collected about individuals, consideration should be given to those individuals’ privacy and consent.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Ethics hasn’t always been a priority in data analytics and data science. Fortunately, the tide appears to be turning here, and will only continue with sustained community support.

<h1>Go Forth and Data How You Please</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p>I’m often asked which of these tools one should focus on given employer demand and trending popularity. My answer: take some time to find out what you like, and let those interests shape your learning path rather than trying to tailor it toward the “next big thing” in analytics tools. These skills are <em>all</em> valuable.&#13;
More important than any one analytics tool is the ability to contextualize and pair those tools, which requires exposure to a broad set of applications. But you can’t become an expert in everything. The best learning strategy will resemble a “T” shape: a wide exposure to various data tools, with relatively deeper knowledge in a handful of them.<a data-primary="Python programming language" data-secondary="Anaconda" data-see="Anaconda, Python" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46274526717080"/><a data-primary="visualization of data" data-secondary="boxplots" data-see="boxplots" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46274526715768"/><a data-primary="qualitative variables" data-see="categorical variables" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46274526714552"/><a data-primary="variables" data-secondary="categorical" data-see="categorical variables" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46274526713608"/><a data-primary="variables" data-secondary="continuous" data-see="continuous variables" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46274526712392"/><a data-primary="coefficient, correlation" data-see="correlation coefficient" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46274526711176"/><a data-primary="ToolPak" data-see="Data Analysis ToolPak, Excel" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46274526710216"/><a data-primary="importing data" data-see="data imports" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46274526709256"/><a data-primary="variables" data-secondary="dependent" data-see="dependent variables" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46274526708312"/><a data-primary="statistics" data-secondary="descriptive" data-see="descriptive statistics" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46274526707096"/><a data-primary="summarizing variables" data-see="descriptive statistics" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46274526705880"/><a data-primary="tidyverse packages, R" data-secondary="dplyr" data-see="dplyr, R" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46274526704936"/><a data-primary="EDA (exploratory data analysis)" data-see="exploratory data analysis (EDA)" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46274526703720"/><a data-primary="directories" data-see="file paths and directories" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46274526702744"/><a data-primary="visualization of data" data-secondary="histograms" data-see="histograms" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46274526701784"/><a data-primary="inferential statistics" data-secondary="steps for" data-see="hypothesis testing" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46274526700568"/><a data-primary="confirmatory data analysis" data-see="hypothesis testing" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46274526699352"/><a data-primary="hypothesis testing" data-secondary="t-tests for" data-see="independent samples t-tests" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46274526698392"/><a data-primary="t-tests" data-see="independent samples t-tests" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46274526697160"/><a data-primary="variables" data-secondary="independent" data-see="independent variables" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46274526696200"/><a data-primary="statistics" data-secondary="inferential" data-see="inferential statistics" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46274526694984"/><a data-primary="regression analysis" data-see="linear regression" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46274526693768"/><a data-primary="Python programming language" data-secondary="modules" data-see="modules, Python" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46274526692824"/><a data-primary="bell curve" data-see="normal distributions" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46274526691592"/><a data-primary="distributions" data-secondary="normal" data-see="normal distributions" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46274526690648"/><a data-primary="modules, Python" data-secondary="pandas" data-see="pandas, Python" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46274526689432"/><a data-primary="hypothesis testing" data-secondary="p-values in" data-see="p-values" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46274526688216"/><a data-primary="linear regression" data-secondary="fitting line in" data-see="regression line" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46274526687000"/><a data-primary="visualization of data" data-secondary="scatterplots" data-see="scatterplots" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46274526685784"/><a data-primary="datasets" data-secondary="Star example" data-see="Star dataset example" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46274526684568"/><a data-primary="charts" data-see="visualization of data" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46274526683352"/><a data-primary="data visualization" data-see="visualization of data" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46274526682408"/><a data-primary="graphs" data-see="visualization of data" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46274526681464"/><a data-primary="plotting charts" data-see="visualization of data" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46274526680520"/></p>&#13;
