- en: This is the last part of the book, where everything comes together. We’ll see
    three powerful tools of behavioral data analysis, first moderation in [Chapter 11](ch11.xhtml#introduction_to_moderation)
    and then mediation and its offspring instrumental variables (IVs) in [Chapter 12](ch12.xhtml#mediation_and_instrumental_variables).

- en: Moderation is a versatile mathematical tool that allows us to understand interaction
    effects, as well as effectively and transparently segment our customer population.
    Mediation allows us to peek into the black box of causal relationships and understand
    *how* a variable affects another. Finally, I’ll use instrumental variables to
    make good on my promise to measure the impact of customer satisfaction on later
    customer behaviors.

- en: Moderation, mediation, and IVs are meaty topics and are the subject of lively
    methodological debates and entire books. But the tools we introduced earlier in
    the book will make the journey much easier. First, using causal diagrams will
    give intuitive interpretations for all three of them. Second, using the Bootstrap
    will allow us to directly build confidence intervals and completely bypass the
    methodological complications associated with p-values. As a result, we’ll be able
    to draw deep and actionable behavioral insights with one-liners of code.
