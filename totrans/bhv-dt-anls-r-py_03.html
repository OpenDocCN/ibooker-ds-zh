<p>In <a data-type="xref" href="ch01.xhtml#the_causal_behavioral_framework_for_da">Chapter 1</a> we discussed that the core goal of this book is to use data analysis in order to understand what drives behavior. This requires understanding the relationship between data and behaviors, which was represented in <a data-type="xref" href="ch01.xhtml#the_causal_behavioral_framework_for_da">Chapter 1</a> by an arrow in the causal-behavioral framework (<a data-type="xref" href="#the_causal_behavioral_framework_with_th">Figure 2-1</a>).</p>

<p>Forgive the pop-culture reference, but if you’ve seen <em>The Matrix</em>, you’ll recall that the main character can look at the world around him and see the numbers behind it. Well, in this chapter you’ll learn to look at your data and see the behaviors behind it.</p>
<p>The first section is mostly directed to readers with a business or data analysis background and offers a basic “behavioral science 101” introduction to core behavioral science concepts. If you’re a behavioral scientist by training, you probably won’t find much that’s new here, but you may want to skim through just to get a feel for the specific terms I use.</p>
<p>Based on that common understanding, the second section will show you how to look at your data through a behavioral lens and determine the behavioral concept related to each variable. In many cases, unfortunately, a variable is at first only loosely related to the corresponding behavior, so we’ll also learn how to “behavioralize” such wayward variables.</p>
<section data-type="sect1" data-pdf-bookmark="A Basic Model of Human Behavior"><div class="sect1" id="a_basic_model_of_human_behavior">
<h1>A Basic Model of Human Behavior</h1>
<p>“Behavior” is one of those words that is highly familiar to us due to repeated exposure but is rarely,<a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="human behavior" data-secondary="basic model" data-tertiary="about behavioral mindset" id="idm45968168085576"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="model of human behavior" data-secondary="about behavioral mindset" id="idm45968168083864"/> if ever, properly defined. I once asked a business partner what behavior she was trying to encourage, and her answer started with “we want them to know that…” In that moment, I realized two things: (1) by helping clarify the goals at hand, I could add more value to that project than I initially expected, and (2) the introduction to behavioral science I had walked her through earlier really sucked if she still thought that knowing something was a behavior. Hopefully I’ll do a better job this time and you’ll come out of this section able to experience the joy of adding more value to your organization.</p>
<p>Indeed, I strongly believe that one of the key benefits of a behavioral mindset is to get people to think more precisely about what it is they’re trying to do. Changing someone’s mind is not the same thing as influencing their actions, and vice versa. For that purpose, I’ll propose a simplified but hopefully actionable model of human behavior, which I’ll first illustrate with an example of how a personal care company could capitalize on a customer’s midlife crisis (<a data-type="xref" href="#our_model_of_human_behavior_for_a_midli">Figure 2-2</a>).</p>
<figure><div id="our_model_of_human_behavior_for_a_midli" class="figure">

<h6><span class="label">Figure 2-2. </span>Our model of human behavior for a midlife crisis</h6>
</div></figure>
<p>In this example, personal characteristics (reaching one’s 40s)<a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="model of human behavior" data-secondary="midlife crisis example" id="idm45968168077304"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="human behavior" data-secondary="basic model" data-tertiary="midlife crisis example" id="idm45968168075928"/> lead to emotions and thoughts (wanting to feel young again), which in turn lead to an intention (deciding to buy a red Corvette). That intention may translate into the corresponding behavior, or it may result in another action (dying one’s hair red instead), depending on business behaviors (running a TV ad).</p>
<p>In some circumstances we may be trying to affect not the behaviors of our customers but those of our employees, suppliers, and so on. We would have to adjust this model accordingly, but the intuition would remain the same: on the one hand, there is a human being whose behavior we’re trying to influence, and on the other hand, there are all the processes, rules, and decisions that our business controls (<a data-type="xref" href="#our_general_model_of_human_behavior">Figure 2-3</a>).</p>

<p>In this model, personal characteristics affect cognition and emotions,<a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="model of human behavior" data-secondary="five components" id="idm45968168069528"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="human behavior" data-secondary="basic model" data-tertiary="about five components" id="idm45968168068152"/> which in turn affect intentions, which affect actions. Business behaviors, in the form of processes, rules, and decisions that we control, affect all three categories.</p>
<p>There are many different models out there, and there’s nothing definitive or magical about this one. But for the data analysis stage, which is the topic of this book, I feel that these five components best correspond to the types of data you’ll encounter. Let’s look at these one by one, reviewing what defines each component and exploring how we can collect and handle data about each in an ethical manner.</p>
<section data-type="sect2" data-pdf-bookmark="Personal Characteristics"><div class="sect2" id="personal_characteristics-id00057">
<h2>Personal Characteristics</h2>
<p>Collecting and using demographic variables such as age, gender, <a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="human behavior" data-secondary="basic model" data-tertiary="personal characteristics" id="idm45968168063336"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="model of human behavior" data-secondary="five components" data-tertiary="personal characteristics" id="idm45968168061624"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="personal characteristics in human behavior" id="idm45968168059960"/>and family situation is a staple of applied analytics, and for good reason: these can often be good predictors of what someone will do. As behavioral data analysts, however, we’ll want to think about personal characteristics both more broadly and more precisely. For our purposes, we’ll define as <em>personal characteristics</em> all the information we have about a person that changes only rarely or very gradually over the relevant time frame for our analysis.</p>
<p>Getting back to the example of C-Mart’s ice cream stands, this means<a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="C-Mart fictional supermarket chain" data-secondary="personal characteristics of customers" id="idm45968168057208"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="working examples" data-see="AirCnC; C-Mart" id="idm45968168055800"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="fictional companies" data-see="AirCnC; C-Mart" id="idm45968168054424"/> including things like personality traits and lifestyle habits. Let’s say that one of your customers has a high degree of openness to experience and is always game to try some new flavor combination like blueberry and cheese; <a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="personal characteristics in human behavior" data-secondary="personality changes over lifetime" id="idm45968168052680"/>you can reasonably consider that trait as a stable personal characteristic for your analysis, even though psychology tells us that personality changes in predictable ways over someone’s lifetime. On the other side of the spectrum, an urban planner looking decades in the future may want to take into account not only gradual changes in lifestyle habits, but also potential divergences whereby the direction of these changes is itself changing. <a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="personal characteristics in human behavior" data-secondary="primary causes" id="idm45968168050664"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="demographic variables" data-secondary="primary causes" id="idm45968168049256"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="causes" data-secondary="primary causes" data-tertiary="demographics as" id="idm45968168047880"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="primary causes" data-secondary="demographics as" id="idm45968168046232"/>In that sense, I think of personal characteristics as “primary causes” defined to avoid an infinite regression: we track their changes but we disregard their own causes.</p>
<p>While demographic variables fit the preceding definition in terms of <a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="demographic variables" data-secondary="personal characteristics in behavior" id="idm45968168044248"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="variables" data-secondary="demographic" data-see="demographic variables" id="idm45968168042824"/>relative stability and primacy, it may not be immediately clear what it means to treat them as causes of cognition, emotions, intentions, and actions. <a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="age as behavioral determinant" id="idm45968168040888"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="gender as behavioral determinant" id="idm45968168039768"/>Some readers may even feel uncomfortable saying that age or gender is causing someone to do something, as it can sound suspiciously like social determinism.</p>
<p>I would argue that we can resolve these issues by defining a cause <a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="causes" data-secondary="contributing factor in probabilistic sense" id="idm45968168037928"/>as a “contributing factor” in a probabilistic sense. Reaching one’s 40s is neither a necessary nor a sufficient reason to have a midlife crisis, and having a midlife crisis is neither a necessary nor a sufficient reason to buy a red Corvette. In fact, both causal relationships are very heavily intertwined with other contributing factors: the contribution of age to existential qualms depends a lot on social patterns such as professional and family trajectories (e.g., the age at which someone enters the labor market or has their first child, assuming they do either one), and resolving such qualms through consumption is possible only if one has enough available income. It is also dependent on the degree to which one is influenced by advertising.</p>
<p>As a behavioral science mantra puts it, “behavior is a function of the person and the environment,” and <a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="environment and behavior" data-secondary="social factors stronger than demographic" id="idm45968168035000"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="social factors stronger than demographic" id="idm45968168033576"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="demographic variables" data-secondary="social factors stronger than" id="idm45968168032440"/>social factors often have arguably more weight than demographic variables. From a causal modeling and data analysis perspective, this interplay between social phenomena and personal characteristics can be captured through the use of moderation and mediation (which we’ll explore in Chapters <a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="select:labelnumber" href="ch11.xhtml#introduction_to_moderation">11</a> and <a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="select:labelnumber" href="ch12.xhtml#mediation_and_instrumental_variables">12</a>).</p>
<p>In that sense, demographic variables are often useful in behavioral data analysis, because their predictive power hints at the presence of other personal characteristics (of which they are a contributing factor) that are more psychological and actionable in nature. For example, law enforcement and nursing are still overwhelmingly gendered fields in the US and many other countries. Noting that empirical regularity is unlikely to earn you any pat on the back. A much more interesting question is how that effect happens. For instance, one hypothesis would be that it stems from social representations and norms about authority and care. Alternatively, one could posit that this phenomenon is self-perpetuating because of the lack of alternative role models. Determining which hypothesis is true (or which has more weight if both are true) could lead to much more effective career counseling for high-schoolers.</p>

<h3>Collecting data and ethical considerations</h3>
<p>Demographic information is widely available and used (one could even say overused)<a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="personal characteristics in human behavior" data-secondary="data and ethical considerations" id="idm45968168024968"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="demographic variables" data-secondary="data and ethical considerations" id="idm45968168023288"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="data" data-secondary="modeling human behavior" data-tertiary="demographic information" id="idm45968168021896"/> in business analytics. The main challenge is to identify and measure other personal characteristics so that you can correctly assign their effects on behaviors instead of unduly attributing them to demographic variables. Market and user research can be very useful here.</p>
<p>Misattributing effects also matters from an ethical perspective:<a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="ethics" data-secondary="data collection for behaviors" data-tertiary="misattributing effects" id="idm45968168019416"/> in many cases, discrimination can be thought of as consciously or unconsciously misattributing <span class="keep-together">behaviors,</span> either current or predicted, to demographic variables. Even when your analysis is correct, you also need to ensure that it doesn’t inadvertently lead to reinforcing patterns of advantage and disadvantage.</p>

<h2>Cognition and Emotions</h2>
<p><em>Cognition and emotions</em> is a phrase I’m using to encompass<a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="human behavior" data-secondary="basic model" data-tertiary="cognition and emotions" id="idm45968168014200"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="model of human behavior" data-secondary="five components" data-tertiary="cognition and emotions" id="idm45968168012552"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="cognition in human behavior" data-secondary="model of behavior" id="idm45968168010904"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="emotions in human behavior" data-secondary="model of behavior" id="idm45968168009512"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="mental states" data-see="cognition; emotions" id="idm45968168008120"/> mental states such as emotions, thoughts, mental models, and beliefs. You can think of it as everything that happens in a customer’s brain apart from intentions and more permanent personal characteristics. For example, is a potential customer aware of your company and its products or services? If so, what do they think about them? What is their mental model of how a bank works? Do they feel a pinch of envy every time they see a sleek new Tesla on the road?</p>
<p>Cognition and emotions encompass all of that, as well as more nebulous business buzzwords and phrases such as <em>customer satisfaction</em> (CSAT) and <em>customer experience</em> (CX).<a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="customer experience (CX)" data-secondary="cognition and emotions" id="idm45968168004728"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="customer satisfaction (CSAT)" data-secondary="cognition and emotions" id="idm45968168003304"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="CX" data-see="customer experience" id="idm45968168001912"/> CX has become a business mantra: many companies have a CX team, and there are conferences, consultants, and books devoted to the topic. But what exactly is it? Can you measure its causes and its effects? Yes, you can, but it requires intellectual humility and the willingness to spend time on sleuthing work.</p>
<section data-type="sect3" data-pdf-bookmark="Collecting data and ethical considerations"><div class="sect3" id="collecting_data_and_ethical_considera">
<h3>Collecting data and ethical considerations</h3>
<p>Cognition and emotions are like psychological personal characteristics<a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="data" data-secondary="modeling human behavior" data-tertiary="cognition and emotions" id="idm45968167998136"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="user experience (UX)" data-secondary="cognition and emotions" id="idm45968167996408"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="cognition in human behavior" data-secondary="data and ethical considerations" id="idm45968167995032"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="emotions in human behavior" data-secondary="data and ethical considerations" id="idm45968167993624"/> in two respects: they generally can’t be observed directly, and the relevant data is collected through surveys or during user experience (UX) observation. It’s important to note that unless you’re using physiological measures, you’ll be relying on <em>stated</em> or <em>observed</em> measures.</p>
<p>This brings us to one of the biggest differences between UX or human-centered design<a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="user experience (UX)" data-secondary="behavioral science versus" id="idm45968167990504"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="human behavior" data-secondary="basic model" data-tertiary="user experience versus behavioral science" id="idm45968167989112"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="UX" data-see="user experience" id="idm45968167987432"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="model of human behavior" data-secondary="user experience versus behavioral science" id="idm45968167986056"/> and behavioral science: UX begins with the presumption that human beings know what they want, how they feel about something, and why, whereas behavioral science begins with the presumption that we are unaware of a lot of things going on in our own heads. To use a legal metaphor, a behavioral scientist will often treat what someone says as suspect until proven trustworthy, whereas a UX researcher will treat it as honest until proven misleading.</p>
<p>However I don’t want to exaggerate the difference, and the distinction often gets blurred in practice, depending on the situation at hand. If a behavioral scientist is told by a customer that a website is confusing and frustrating to use, they will take a page from the UX book and trust that the customer did indeed experience negative emotions. Conversely, when doing foundational product research, a skilled UX researcher will often go beyond stated intentions and attempt to identify a customer’s deeper needs.</p>
<p>From an ethical perspective, trying to change someone’s <a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="ethics" data-secondary="data collection for behaviors" data-tertiary="cognition and emotions influenced" id="idm45968167982696"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="NYT (New York Times) test of intentions" id="idm45968167980936"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="ethics" data-secondary="New York Times test of intentions" id="idm45968167979816"/>cognition and emotions is definitely a gray area. My recommended litmus test in that regard is the “NYT” test: are your intentions and methods benevolent and transparent enough that your boss’s boss wouldn’t mind seeing them displayed on the front page of the <em>New York Times</em>? Advertising strives to affect people’s thoughts and emotions, but I don’t expect to ever see a headline reading, “Companies spending billions to make people want their stuff”; it would be met by a big yawn anyway. <a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="sludges" data-secondary="NYT test failure" id="idm45968167977352"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="ethics" data-secondary="sludges" id="idm45968167975976"/>On the other hand, “sludges”—manipulative behavioral science tricks such as “three other people are looking at this property right now!”—and good old-fashioned lies wouldn’t pass that test. This still leaves many honest opportunities to apply behavioral science: for example, explaining your product’s benefits in terms that resonate better with your customers’ mental models or making a purchasing experience easier or more enjoyable. Because the topic of this book is data analysis and not behavioral design, we’ll look only at how to analyze such interventions, not how to develop them.</p>

<h2>Intentions</h2>

As such, intentions bring us one step closer to actions.</p>
<p>Technically speaking, an intention is a mental state that could<a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="intentions" data-secondary="about" id="idm45968167966008"/> have been included in the previous category of cognition and emotions, but I felt it deserved its own category because of its importance in applied behavioral data analysis. Unless you plan to force customers down a certain path (e.g., remove the phone number from your website so that they don’t call you), you’ll generally have to use their intention as a conduit for behavior change.</p>
<p>In addition, people often fail to follow through on things they want to do, a <a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="intentions" data-secondary="intention-action gap" id="idm45968167963608"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="actions" data-secondary="intention-action gap" id="idm45968167962136"/>concept known in behavioral science as the intention-action gap. (As an example, think of New Year’s resolutions and how often they are broken.) Therefore, a key to driving customer behavior is determining whether a potential response doesn’t occur because the customers <em>don’t want to</em> take that action or because something happens between intention and action.</p>

<h3>Collecting data and ethical considerations</h3>
<p>In the general course of business, we usually don’t have direct data on intentions.<a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="intentions" data-secondary="data and ethical considerations" id="idm45968167958024"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="data" data-secondary="modeling human behavior" data-tertiary="intentions" id="idm45968167956488"/> Therefore most of this data will come from customer statements, generally via two sources:</p>
<dl class="pagebreak-before less_space">
<dt>Surveys</dt>
<dd><p>These can be either “in the moment” (e.g., at the end of a website<a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="surveys" data-secondary="intention data collection" id="idm45968167952872"/> or store visit) or asynchronous (e.g., administered by mail, email, or phone)</p></dd>
<dt>User experience observations</dt>
<dd><p>In these user experience observations a UX researcher asks a <a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="user experience (UX)" data-secondary="intention observations" id="idm45968167950216"/>subject to go through a certain experience and collects information about their intentions (either by asking them to think aloud during the process or by asking questions afterward, such as, “What were you trying to do at that point?”).</p></dd>
</dl>
<p>Alternatively, we’ll often try to infer intentions from observed behaviors, which is known in analytics as “intent modeling.”<a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="intentions" data-secondary="modeling human behavior" data-tertiary="intent modeling" id="idm45968167947624"/></p>
<p>From an ethical perspective, influencing someone’s intentions is the <a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="ethics" data-secondary="data collection for behaviors" data-tertiary="intention influencing" id="idm45968167945560"/>objective of advertising, marketing, and the dark arts of persuasion. It can be done, and I genuinely believe it can even be done ethically in a number of situations, as UX and behavioral researchers strive to do. But the simple truth is that it’s generally hard to do and it can backfire. It is much simpler and safer to identify spots where you can help customers bridge the intention-action gap. <a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="pain points as obstacles to intent" id="idm45968167943224"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="intentions" data-secondary="pain points as obstacles to" id="idm45968167942104"/>To recast a common business phrase in our model, a “pain point” often reflects an obstacle to achieving an intent.</p>

<section data-type="sect2" data-pdf-bookmark="Actions"><div class="sect2" id="actions">
<h2>Actions</h2>
<p>An <em>action</em> is the basic unit of a <em>behavior</em>,<a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="model of human behavior" data-secondary="five components" data-tertiary="action" id="idm45968167937688"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="human behavior" data-secondary="basic model" data-tertiary="action" id="idm45968167936008"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="actions" data-secondary="about" id="idm45968167934360"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="actions" data-secondary="modeling human behavior" id="idm45968167932984"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="behavior as action" data-seealso="actions; business behaviors; human behavior" id="idm45968167931608"/> and I’ll often use these two words interchangeably. The rule of thumb I often give people is that an action or behavior is something you should be able to observe if you were in the room at that moment without having to ask the person. “Buying something on Amazon” is an action. So is “reading a review of a product on Amazon.” But “knowing something” or “deciding to buy something on Amazon” is not. You can’t know that someone has made a decision unless you either ask them or see them acting on that decision (which is a consequence but not the same thing).</p>

If you’re sending people a coupon for a free visit and they show up, you’ve achieved your goal, and there is no need to think more deeply. However, if you’re working on a wellness app and you want to make sure that people stay on track with their program, you’ll need to be much more granular than that. <a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="Wendel, Stephen" data-secondary="granularity of actions" id="idm45968167927192"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="behavior blocker granularity" id="idm45968167925816"/>I once attended a presentation by behavioral scientist Steve Wendel in which he walked the audience through “going to the gym” step by step (putting on gym clothes, going to the car, deciding what exercise to do once at the gym, and so on). This is the level of detail you’ll often need to employ if you are attempting to identify and resolve behavioral blockers. The same would apply to a customer journey on a website or in an app. What does “signing up” mean? What information do they need to retrieve and enter? What choices are you asking them to make?</p>

<h3>Collecting data and ethical considerations</h3>
<p>Action or behavior data often represents the largest category of<a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="actions" data-secondary="data and ethical considerations" id="idm45968167921992"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="data" data-secondary="modeling human behavior" data-tertiary="action or behavior data" id="idm45968167920520"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="transactional data" id="idm45968167918872"/> available customer data and generally falls under the heading of “transactional data.” In many circumstances, however, this data will need some additional processing to truly reflect behaviors. We’ll look more closely at this in the second section of this chapter.</p>
<p>If you’re targeting employee behavior (e.g., in people analytics or to reduce attrition), data may be much sparser and harder to access, as it will often need to be pulled from business process software and may not be recorded as a matter of course.</p>
<p>Let’s call a spade a spade: modifying behavior is the ultimate goal of behavioral analytics. In some instances, it can be very simple: if you remove your customer service phone number from your website, fewer people will call you. Whether or not that’s a good idea is a different story. <a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="modifying behavior reference books" id="idm45968167915944"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="behavior modification reference books" id="idm45968167914824"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="Thaler, Richard" id="idm45968167913704"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="Sunstein, Cass" id="idm45968167912600"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="Nudge: Improving Decisions About Health, Wealth, and Happiness (Thaler and Sunstein)" id="idm45968167911496"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="Eyal, Nir" id="idm45968167910424"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="Hooked: How to Build Habit-Forming Products (Eyal)" id="idm45968167909320"/>And obviously, behavior modification can sometimes be extremely difficult, as illustrated by the large and growing literature on behavior change.<sup><a data-type="noteref" id="ch01fn4-marker" href="ch02.xhtml#ch01fn4">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Either way, the goal of modifying behavior comes with ethical responsibilities.<a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="ethics" data-secondary="data collection for behaviors" data-tertiary="modifying behavior" id="idm45968167905736"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="NYT (New York Times) test of intentions" id="idm45968167904056"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="ethics" data-secondary="New York Times test of intentions" id="idm45968167902936"/> Here again, the NYT question is my recommended litmus test.</p>

<li><p>Communication such as emails and letters</p></li>
<li><p>Changes to website language or in the talk path for a call center representative</p></li>

</ul>
<section data-type="sect3" data-pdf-bookmark="Collecting data"><div class="sect3" id="collecting_data">
<h3>Collecting data</h3>
<p>Business behaviors can be both a blessing and a curse to behavioral data analysts.<a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="business behaviors" data-secondary="data and ethical considerations" id="idm45968167888152"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="data" data-secondary="modeling human behavior" data-tertiary="business behaviors" id="idm45968167886808"/> On the one hand, from an intervention design perspective, they’re one of our main levers to drive individual behaviors: for example, we could modify the content of a letter or the frequency of an email to persuade a customer to pay their bill on time. As such, business behaviors are an extremely valuable tool without which our job would be significantly harder, and when we are the ones making changes to business behaviors, it is generally reasonably easy to collect the corresponding data. <a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="ethics" data-secondary="data collection for behaviors" data-tertiary="business behaviors" id="idm45968167884520"/>Another advantage of business behaviors is that there are fewer ethical considerations about data collection: organizations are generally free to collect data about their own operations and their employees’ behavior in the normal course of business (although there are certainly circumstances where it can be considered an invasion of privacy).</p>
<p>On the other hand, from a data collection and analysis perspective, business behaviors can be an analyst’s worst nightmare: like water to fish, they can be invisible to an organization, and their effects on individual behaviors then become intractable noise. This happens for two reasons.</p>
<p>First, many organizations, if they track business behaviors at all, simply don’t track them at the same level of detail as customer behaviors. <a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="C-Mart fictional supermarket chain" data-secondary="business behavior data collection" id="idm45968167881064"/>Let’s say that C-Mart experimented with reducing its hours of business in the summer of 2018, leading to a temporary reduction in sales. Good luck figuring that out from the data alone! Many business rules, even when they are implemented in software, are simply not logged anywhere in a machine-readable format. If the corresponding data has indeed been recorded, it is often stored only in a departmental database (or worse, an Excel file) instead of the enterprise data lake.</p>
<p>Second, business behaviors can affect the interpretation of variables for customer behaviors.<a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="customer behavior" data-secondary="business behaviors affecting interpretation" id="idm45968167878504"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="sludges" data-secondary="business behaviors and customer behavior interpretation" id="idm45968167877096"/> The clearest example of that would be <em>sludges</em>—intentional frictions and misleading communication introduced to confuse customers. Imagine a form on a website which, when you enter your email address, automatically checks the box “I want to receive marketing emails” that you had unchecked at the beginning of the form. Would that checked box really indicate that the customer wants to receive marketing emails? Beyond such obvious examples, business behaviors can be found lurking behind many customer behaviors, especially in the realm of sales. Many propensity-to-buy models should have as a caveat “among the people our sales team decided to call.” Paradoxically, while the compensation structure of sales representatives is often one of the levers that business leaders obsess most about, it is rarely included in models of customer purchasing behaviors.</p>
<p>Ultimately, getting reliable data about business behaviors, especially over time, can be a formidable challenge for behavioral data analysts—but that means that it’s also one way they can create value for their organization before running any analysis.</p>

<h1>How to Connect Behaviors and Data</h1>
<p>Personal characteristics, cognition and emotions, intentions, actions, and business behaviors:<a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="data" data-secondary="connecting behaviors and data" id="idm45968167871768"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="human behavior" data-secondary="connecting data and behavior" id="idm45968167870376"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="data" data-secondary="GitHub for" data-see="GitHub" id="idm45968167868984"/> these are the concepts we have at our disposal to represent and understand our world as behavioral data analysts. However, connecting behaviors and data is not simply a matter of assigning the variables at hand to one of these buckets. Being “about behaviors” is not enough for a variable to qualify as “behavioral data”; as we saw in the previous section, for instance, a variable supposedly about customer behavior may really only reflect a business rule. In this section, I’ll give you a list of tips to behavioralize your data and ensure that it fits as closely as possible the qualitative reality it’s supposed to represent.</p>
<p>To make things more concrete, we’ll look at our second fictional company,<a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="AirCnC (Air Coach and Couch)" data-secondary="connecting data and behavior" id="idm45968167866136"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="CSAT" data-see="customer satisfaction" id="idm45968167864728"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="customer satisfaction (CSAT)" data-secondary="measuring effect on future purchasing" id="idm45968167863352"/> Air Coach and Couch (AirCnC), an online travel-and-lodging booking company. AirCnC’s leadership has asked their analyst to measure the effect of CSAT on future purchasing behavior, namely the amount spent in the six months following a booking (<em>M6Spend</em>), one of their key performance indicators. We’ll answer that common but intractable business question by the end of the book, in <a data-type="xref" href="ch12.xhtml#mediation_and_instrumental_variables">Chapter 12</a>. For now, we’ll just see how to get started with framing it.</p>
<section data-type="sect2" data-pdf-bookmark="Develop a Behavioral Integrity Mindset"><div class="sect2" id="developing_a_behavioral_integrity_minds">
<h2>Develop a Behavioral Integrity Mindset</h2>
<p>Because behavioral science is so new to businesses, you’ll generally<a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="data" data-secondary="connecting behaviors and data" data-tertiary="existing data and legacy processes" id="idm45968167857976"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="human behavior" data-secondary="connecting data and behavior" data-tertiary="existing data and legacy processes" id="idm45968167856168"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="variables" data-secondary="existing data and legacy processes" id="idm45968167854488"/> be the first person to bring that lens to your organization’s data, which will likely contain dozens, if not hundreds or even thousands, of variables. That’s a daunting task, but adopting the right mindset will help you make sense of it and get started.</p>
<p>Imagine for a second that you’re a structural engineer who has been newly assigned the responsibility of maintaining a bridge. You could start on one end of it and assess its integrity inch by inch (or centimeter by centimeter) until you’ve reached the other end and then come up with a 10-year plan to reach perfect structural integrity. Meanwhile potholes are getting worse, endangering automobilists and damaging their vehicles trip after trip. A sounder approach would be to take a quick look around, prioritize major problems that can be fixed quickly, and identify places where temporary expedients will do until you have the time and budget to make more structural changes.<sup><a data-type="noteref" id="ch01fn5-marker" href="ch02.xhtml#ch01fn5">2</a></sup></p>
<p>The same mindset applies to your data. Unless you happen to be among the very first employees of a startup, you’ll be dealing with existing data and legacy processes. Don’t panic, and don’t start going through your table list in alphabetical order. Start with a specific business problem and identify the variables that are most likely to be inaccurate, in decreasing order of their importance for the business problem:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Causes and effects of interest</p></li>
<li><p>Mediators and moderators, if relevant</p></li>
<li><p>Any potential confounder</p></li>
<li><p>Other nonconfounding independent variables (a.k.a. covariates)</p></li>
</ol>
<p>You’ll have to make judgment calls along the way: for example, should you include a certain variable in your analysis, or is it so poorly defined that you’re better off without it? Unfortunately, there is no clear-cut criterion to make these calls correctly; you’ll have to rely on your business sense and expertise. There is, however, a clear-cut way to make these calls <em>incorrectly</em>: pretend that they don’t exist. A variable will or will not be included in your analysis, and there is no way around that fact. If your instinct leans toward inclusion, as is likely, then document why, describe potential sources of error, and indicate how the results would be different if the variable were omitted. As a UX researcher once put it in a friendly chat with me, being a researcher in business means constantly figuring out “what you can get away with.”</p>

<section data-type="sect2" data-pdf-bookmark="Distrust and Verify"><div class="sect2" id="distrust_and_verify">
<h2>Distrust and Verify</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, in many circumstances, the way data is recorded is <a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="data" data-secondary="connecting behaviors and data" data-tertiary="distrust and verify" id="idm45968167843128"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="human behavior" data-secondary="connecting data and behavior" data-tertiary="distrust and verify" id="idm45968167841384"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="variables" data-secondary="existing data and legacy processes" data-tertiary="distrust and verify" id="idm45968167839720"/>driven by business and financial rules and is transaction-centric rather than customer-centric. This means that you should consider variables suspicious until proven innocent: in other words, do not automatically assume that the variable <em>CustomerDidX</em> means that the customer did X. It may mean something entirely different. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The customer checked a box without reading the fine print that mentioned that they were agreeing to X.</p></li>
<li><p>The customer didn’t say anything, so we defaulted them to X.</p></li>
<li><p>The customer stated that they did X, but we can’t verify.</p></li>
<li><p>We bought data from a vendor indicating that the customer regularly did X at some point in their life.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Even if the customer actually did X, we can’t assume their intent. They may have done this:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Because we sent them a reminder email</p></li>
<li><p>Four times in a row because the page was not refreshing</p></li>
<li><p>Mistakenly, when they really wanted to do Y</p></li>
<li><p>A week ago, but due to regulatory constraints we recorded it only today</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In other words, to paraphrase a popular line from <em>The Princess Bride</em>: “You keep using that variable. I do not think it means what you think it means.”</p>

<section data-type="sect2" data-pdf-bookmark="Identify the Category"><div class="sect2" id="identify_the_category">
<h2>Identify the Category</h2>
<p>As stated, AirCnC’s leadership has tasked its analysts with<a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="AirCnC (Air Coach and Couch)" data-secondary="connecting data and behavior" id="idm45968167828072"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="customer satisfaction (CSAT)" data-secondary="measuring effect on future purchasing" id="idm45968167826536"/> understanding the effects of CSAT on purchasing behaviors, which is a tall order. Our first step is to figure out what we’re talking about.</p>
<p>In my first year of college, my philosophy professor would give us<a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="data" data-secondary="connecting behaviors and data" data-tertiary="categorizing data" id="idm45968167824424"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="human behavior" data-secondary="connecting data and behavior" data-tertiary="categorizing data" id="idm45968167822680"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="variables" data-secondary="existing data and legacy processes" data-tertiary="categorize to understand" id="idm45968167821016"/> essay prompts such as “What is progress?” and “Man and the Machine.” Along with them, he offered some excellent advice if we got stumped: in his words, we should figure out, in his words, “what book this is a chapter of.” Paradoxically, when a question seems intimidatingly big and intractable, it often helps to ask what broader category it belongs to.</p>
<p>Fortunately, as behavioral data analysts, we don’t need to roam the Library of Congress for inspiration; we have the tailor-made categorization from earlier in the <span class="keep-together">chapter:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Personal characteristics</p></li>
<li><p>Cognition and emotions</p></li>
<li><p>Intentions</p></li>
<li><p>Actions (a.k.a. behaviors)</p></li>
<li><p>Business behaviors and processes</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s proceed by elimination. Customer satisfaction is not fixed and permanent, so it’s not part of personal characteristics. It’s neither something people do, nor something people intend to do, so it’s not a behavior or an intention. Finally, it’s not something happening purely on the business side, so it’s not a business behavior or process. <a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="customer satisfaction (CSAT)" data-secondary="cognition and emotions" id="idm45968167813512"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="customer experience (CX)" data-secondary="cognition and emotions" id="idm45968167812120"/>Therefore, customer satisfaction is part of cognitions and emotions, as is its cousin customer experience. The second variable in our business problem, “purchasing behaviors,” is much easier to categorize: it’s obviously a customer behavior.</p>
<p>In my experience, many business analytics projects fail or deliver underwhelming results because the analyst has not clarified what the project is about. Organizations always have an overarching target metric—profit for companies, client outcomes for nonprofits, etc. At a lower level, departments often have their own target metrics, such as Net Promoter Score for the customer experience team, downtime percent for IT, etc. If a business partner asks you to measure or improve a variable that seems unrelated to one of these target metrics, it generally means that they have in mind an implicit and possibly faulty behavioral theory connecting the two.</p>
<p>“Customer engagement,” another buzzword concept that behavioral scientists<a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="customer behavior" data-secondary="customer engagement" id="idm45968167808840"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="engagement as behavior" id="idm45968167807368"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="business behaviors" data-secondary="customer engagement" id="idm45968167806264"/> are often asked to improve, is a good example of that phenomenon. It’s not clear cut where it belongs, because it could really refer to two different things:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A behavior, namely the broad pattern of interactions with the business: customer A is deemed more engaged than customer B if customer A logs on to the website more often and spends more time navigating it.</p></li>
<li><p>A cognition or emotion, as when an audience is “engaged” with a movie or a course because they are engrossed in the flow and eager to know what comes next.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Indeed, I strongly believe that the confusion between these two things explains a large part of the appeal of engagement metrics for startups and the broader digital world, even though they may be misleading. For example, in the first sense of the word, I’m more engaged with my washing machine when it stops working; that doesn’t translate into enjoyment and eagerness in the second sense of the word. Organizations that try to increase engagement as a behavior are often disappointed with the results. When engagement as behavior doesn’t translate into engagement as emotion, it doesn’t lead to desirable outcomes such as higher loyalty and retention.</p>
<p>As a personal example, a business partner once asked me for help to get employees to do a certain training. After some discussion, it became clear that what she really wanted was for employees to comply with a business rule; she believed that they didn’t comply because they were not sufficiently informed about the rule. We pivoted the project toward understanding why employees didn’t comply and how to encourage them to do so. In short: beware the self-diagnosing patients!</p>
<p>We can now recast our business problem in our model of human behavior: <a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="AirCnC (Air Coach and Couch)" data-secondary="connecting data and behavior" id="idm45968167800136"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="customer satisfaction (CSAT)" data-secondary="measuring effect on future purchasing" id="idm45968167798648"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="cognition in human behavior" data-secondary="measuring effect on behavior" id="idm45968167797240"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="emotions in human behavior" data-secondary="measuring effect on behavior" id="idm45968167795832"/>AirCnC leaders want to know whether a cognition/emotion affects a behavior in customers, and if so, how much. Indeed, in the overwhelming majority of business analytics problems, at least one of the variables involved is a behavior, either of a customer or of the business. Are customers more satisfied if we send them a follow-up email? Are satisfied customers more likely to buy?</p>
<p>If, after identifying the categories of the relevant variables, none of them falls under the customer or business behavior categories, it should raise alarms. This suggests a business problem without a clear “So what?” Let’s say that older customers are more satisfied. So what? What are we going to do with that information? Business outcomes are driven by behaviors, either ours or those of our customers.</p>
<p>Once you have identified the relevant behaviors, it’s time to drill down on the corresponding variables.</p>
</div></section>
<section data-type="sect2" data-pdf-bookmark="Refine Behavioral Variables"><div class="sect2" id="refine_behavioral_variables">
<h2>Refine Behavioral Variables</h2>
<p>As I mentioned earlier, a variable being “about a behavior” is not<a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="data" data-secondary="connecting behaviors and data" data-tertiary="behavioral variables refined" id="idm45968167790872"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="human behavior" data-secondary="connecting data and behavior" data-tertiary="behavioral variables refined" id="idm45968167789064"/> the same thing as being a behavioral variable. You’ll often have to transform them to make them truly behavioral.</p>
<p>Let’s focus on customer behaviors, as they are more intuitive, but the logic applies similarly to business behaviors. A good behavioral variable will have the following characteristics:<a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="variables" data-secondary="behavioral variable characteristics" id="idm45968167786504"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="behavioral variable characteristics" id="idm45968167785112"/></p>
<dl>
<dt>Observable</dt>
<dd><p>As mentioned in <a data-type="xref" href="ch01.xhtml#the_causal_behavioral_framework_for_da">Chapter 1</a>, a behavior is observable, at least in principle. If you were in the room with the customer, could you <em>see</em> them do it? Abandoning a booking in the middle of the process is observable; changing one’s mind is not. A good clue is that if it doesn’t have a timestamp, it’s probably not concrete and granular enough.</p></dd>
<dt>Individual</dt>
<dd><p>Businesses often rely on aggregate metrics such as rates or proportions<a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="data" data-secondary="aggregate metrics" id="idm45968167779736"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="aggregate metrics" id="idm45968167778280"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="biases in data and analyses" data-secondary="aggregate metrics" id="idm45968167777176"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="confounders" data-secondary="aggregate metrics" id="idm45968167775736"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="time intervals" data-secondary="aggregate metric hazards" id="idm45968167774360"/> (e.g., proportion of customers who cancel their account). Aggregate metrics can offer useful snapshots for reporting purposes, but they can fall prey to biases and confounding factors such as changes in population composition (a.k.a. customer mix), especially when they are calculated based on time intervals.</p></dd>
<dd><p>For example, let’s imagine that a successful marketing campaign brings a lot of new users to AirCnC’s website. Let’s also assume that in that line of business, a significant share of new customers cancel their account in their first month. Thus AirCnC’s daily cancel rate may spike alarmingly during the month following the campaign, even though nothing went wrong. A good rule of thumb is that sound aggregate variables are based on sound individual variables. If a variable makes sense only in the aggregate and doesn’t have a meaningful interpretation at the individual level, that’s a red flag. In our example, a meaningful individual counterpart to the cancellation rate would be the cancellation probability. When controlling for individual characteristics and tenure with the company, this metric would remain stable despite the influx of new customers.</p></dd>
<dt>Atomic</dt>
<dd><p>Similarly, businesses often aggregate together a variety of different <a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="intentions" data-secondary="atomic versus aggregate data" id="idm45968167770088"/>behaviors sharing a common intent. For example, there might be three different ways for a customer to change their billing address with AirCnC: by going to their account settings, by editing the information when finalizing a booking, and by contacting the call center. These would look different to someone watching the customer in the moment, but may be logged similarly in the database. Again, I don’t want to suggest that aggregate behavioral variables are inherently bad. There are certainly analyses that call for using the binary variable <em>ChangedBillingInformation</em>. But at the very least, you should be aware of the concrete ways it can be done, and it doesn’t hurt to check whenever possible that the overall conclusion you reached applies to each one of them.</p></dd>
</dl>

<p>In many circumstances, identifying or creating a satisfying behavioral variable involves “getting your hands dirty.” Databases for analytical or research purposes often offer a “cleaned-up” version of the truth as it would appear in the transaction databases, listing only the most up-to-date, vetted-out information. This makes perfect sense in most circumstances: if a customer made a booking and then canceled and was refunded, we wouldn’t want that amount to count toward the <em>AmountSpent</em> variable. After all, from a business perspective, AirCnC didn’t get to keep that money. However, from a behavioral perspective, that customer is different from a customer who didn’t make any booking over the same time period, and there are analyses for which it would be relevant to take it into account. Don’t go and learn an ancient programming language like COBOL just to access the lowest level databases, but it’s worth digging around a bit beyond your usual pretty tables.</p>

<section data-type="sect2" data-pdf-bookmark="Understand the Context"><div class="sect2" id="understand_the_context">
<h2>Understand the Context</h2>
<p>To reiterate, “behavior is a function of the person and the environment” <a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="data" data-secondary="connecting behaviors and data" data-tertiary="context understood" id="idm45968167763560"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="human behavior" data-secondary="connecting data and behavior" data-tertiary="context understood" id="idm45968167761944"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="context dependency of human behavior" data-secondary="contextual variables" id="idm45968167760280"/>is a fundamental principle in behavioral science. While personal variables are certainly important, I feel that analysts often rely too much on them because they are readily available, and as a result, they may not think enough about contextual variables.</p>
<p>Often the best way to understand the context(s) in which people behave is through qualitative research such as interviews and surveys, whose insights can be used to generate new variables. Here, I’ll focus on how we can tease contextual information out of existing data:</p>
<dl>
<dt>It’s about time</dt>
<dd><p>As mentioned earlier, a behavior is observable. You can<a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="timestamps for contextual variables" id="idm45968167756216"/> pinpoint the moment in time when it happened, at least in theory and often in practice, thanks to timestamps. Timestamps are gold nuggets for behavioral analysts because they provide intuitive and often readily actionable insights. Unsurprisingly, there’s no ready-made algorithm to extract these, only rules of thumb reliant on business sense and the specificities of the problem at hand. I’ll give you the most common cues to look for:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Frequency</dt>
<dd><p>A natural inclination with behavioral and, more broadly, event data is to look at <em>frequency</em>,<a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="frequency as contextual variable" id="idm45968167752280"/> the count of events/behaviors per unit of time. Unfortunately, frequency data can sometimes misbehave and exhibit artificial discontinuities that do not reflect changes in behaviors. For example, let’s say that an AirCnC customer takes a vacation every summer and every winter, which translates into two bookings per year. However, one year they take their <span class="keep-together">winter</span> vacation in January instead of December. We would count one vacation in the earlier year and three in the latter even though behaviors didn’t really change. Such catch-up phenomena—longer durations followed by shorter ones, are best understood by tracking durations directly. For other behaviors, bygones are bygones, and frequency will be a more robust metric.</p></dd>
<dt>Duration</dt>
<dd><p>Duration also offers a natural way to measure decaying effects.<a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="duration" data-secondary="contextual variables" id="idm45968167748600"/> Things that you did or that happened a long time ago tend to have smaller effects than more recent occurrences. This often makes duration a good predictive variable. If a customer hasn’t left AirCnC after a bad experience five years ago it probably doesn’t impact their decisions much anymore, and it would be better to weight the CSAT of past trips by how long ago they happened rather than just use an average.</p></dd>
<dt>Contiguity</dt>
<dd><p>Similarly, behaviors that are very close to each other are often no <a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="contiguity as contextual variable" id="idm45968167745592"/>coincidence and can provide clues to what’s going on. A customer calling AirCnC’s call center to change their billing information <em>after</em> having tried to change it online exhibits a different behavior compared to a customer who calls directly. Siloed data makes omnichannel analytics projects a daunting task, but managing to bring together data from different channels will pay large dividends. One of the best ways to aggregate behavioral data is to create variables for “doing Z after doing X.”</p></dd>
<dt>Social schedules</dt>
<dd><p>People are more likely to be at work, or on their way to or from it,<a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="social schedules as contextual variables" id="idm45968167742328"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="schedules as contextual variables" id="idm45968167741048"/> Monday through Friday during the day.<sup><a data-type="noteref" id="ch01fn6-marker" href="ch02.xhtml#ch01fn6">3</a></sup> A customer leisurely scrolling through holiday destinations on a Saturday morning may be at their kid’s sport practice. Modern life has its rhythms and schedules that are common knowledge. Because of their granularity, it is often better to start with an “hour of the week” variable instead of having separate “hour of the day” and “day of the week” variables (in local time, of course). Depending on your line of business, you may be able to aggregate things further into variables like “weekday evenings,” etc.</p></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dt>Information and “known unknowns”</dt>
<dd><p>If a tree falls in a forest and it’s recorded in your data, but no customer heard it, <a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="information unknown" data-secondary="contextual variables" id="idm45968167737048"/>did it make a sound? Your organization and your customers often know things at different points in time. Variables used in relation to a behavior should always reflect the information available to the person doing it while they’re doing it. This can be as simple as replacing “date sent” with “expected date received” for mail you’re sending your customer, and vice versa for the mail they send you. People don’t know the content of emails they haven’t opened. As always, this is part common sense and part behavioral logic, but it will help ensure that your variables snugly fit the corresponding behaviors.</p></dd>
<dt>The dog that didn’t bark</dt>
<dd><p>Sometimes people do one thing instead of another, and sometimes they don’t have a choice (or they don’t see one). What people <em>don’t</em> do can often be as interesting as what they do. One way to identify alternative behaviors is to look for forks: if behavior B happens often after behavior A, what other behavior C also happens often after A? Conversely, if behavior D often happens after behavior B, what other behaviors lead to behavior D? This can allow you to identify “happy paths” or customers getting lost on their way to getting a job done.</p></dd>
</dl>
<p>Better understanding the context for a behavior is one of the ways the behavioral perspective brings value to business analytics projects like AirCnC’s. <a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="AirCnC (Air Coach and Couch)" data-secondary="connecting data and behavior" id="idm45968167732344"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="customer satisfaction (CSAT)" data-secondary="measuring effect on future purchasing" id="idm45968167730936"/>Does AirCnC’s leadership want to measure customers’ satisfaction with their online booking experience, with their stay, or with AirCnC’s service representatives (among many other possibilities)? You can ask a customer how satisfied they are at any point starting right after their very first interaction with AirCnC and they’ll give you an answer, but it doesn’t guarantee that the answers mean the same thing, or even that they mean <span class="keep-together">anything.</span></p>
<p>In our case, what AirCnC’s leadership really wants is to understand how much customer satisfaction after a service call matters. This will help them determine if they should invest more in hiring and training high-quality representatives, or alternatively if they can outsource service to a country with lower wages (hint: they probably shouldn’t).</p>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>One of the joys and challenges of applied behavioral science is that it involves a constant back and forth between qualitative and quantitative analysis. My intent in this chapter has been to arm you with a basic model of human behavior and actionable tips so that you can start flexing that muscle and connecting behaviors to data. This means that even before running any data analysis, you can add value to your organization by improving the behavioral integrity of its data and clarifying how to approach business problems.</p>
<p>In the next part of the book, we’ll introduce the third pillar of the causal-behavioral framework, namely causal diagrams that will allow us to build relationships between behaviors.</p>
