- en: 'This book is aimed at the data scientist with some familiarity with the *R*
    and/or *Python* programming languages, and with some prior (perhaps spotty or
    ephemeral) exposure to statistics. Two of the authors came to the world of data
    science from the world of statistics, and have some appreciation of the contribution
    that statistics can make to the art of data science. At the same time, we are
    well aware of the limitations of traditional statistics instruction: statistics
    as a discipline is a century and a half old, and most statistics textbooks and
    courses are laden with the momentum and inertia of an ocean liner. All the methods
    in this book have some connection—historical or methodological—to the discipline
    of statistics. Methods that evolved mainly out of computer science, such as neural
    nets, are not included.'

    of the book and gave us detailed and helpful corrections and comments. Likewise,
    Anya McGuirk and Wei Xiao, statisticians at SAS, and Jay Hilfiger, fellow O’Reilly
    author, provided helpful feedback on initial drafts of the book. Toshiaki Kurokawa,
    who translated the first edition into Japanese, did a comprehensive job of reviewing
    and correcting in the process. Aaron Schumacher and Walter Paczkowski thoroughly
    reviewed the second edition of the book and provided numerous helpful and valuable
    suggestions for which we are extremely grateful. Needless to say, any errors that
    remain are ours alone.

    corrected and improved our writing with care and patience, while Ellen Troutman-Zaig
    prepared the index. Nicole Tache took over the reins for the second edition and
    has both guided the process effectively and provided many good editorial suggestions
    to improve the readability of the book for a broad audience. We also thank Marie
    Beaugureau, who initiated our project at O’Reilly, as well as Ben Bengfort, O’Reilly
