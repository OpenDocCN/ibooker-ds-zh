- en: Jha & Shayo (2019) randomly split 1345 Jewish Israeli voters between financial
    asset treatment and control groups. They reported that exposure to the stock market
    increases 4-6% the probability of voting for parties that favor a peaceful resolution
    of the conflict. Let’s open the dataset of Jha & Shayo (2019). Each row is a Israeli
    citizen.

    2013 election. But in 2015, the left-wing party received 24.8% of the votes in
    the control group against 30.9% in the treatment group. In a reverse way, the
    right-wing party received 35.8% of the votes in the control group against 31.2%
    in the treatment group. According to Jha & Shayo (2019), both right and left parties
    are similar in terms of economic policies. The main difference is that the left
    party favors a peaceful process, while the right party sees that any concession
    for peace would put at risk the State of Israel.

    The exceptions are age and willingness to take risks. Israelites in the treatment
    group are younger than the control group (39.3 vs. 41.5 years old). The treatment
    group also has a higher preference to take risks evaluated in an index that varies
    from 1 to 10 (4.7 vs. 4.3).

    It is worth mentioning that this type of experiment rarely has full compliance.
    Usually, when it is necessary to follow individuals over time, there is an attrition
    rate for both the control and treatment groups.

    most interesting group: swing voters. The use of weights allows reproducing the

    to conclude that Palestinian stocks have no effect. In the period of the experiment,
    the price of Israeli stocks increased but the Palestinian stocks decreased.

- en: Column 1 of Table 2 presents the First Stage regression. The ITT (“assettreat”)
    is the Instrumental Variable (IV) for compliance assignment (“asset_comp”). The
    variable “asset_comp” indicates who actually completed the experiment. After controlling
    for several covariates and Strata Fixed Effects, the coefficient of ITT is statistically
    significant. The variable “assettreat” is a perfect IV. This variable was randomized.
    Therefore, it is uncorrelated with the error term.

- en: Column 2 shows the result of the Control Function Approach (CF). The estimate
    of the treatment effect on the treated (TOT) is 7.3%. The treated individuals
    have the probability of voting for the left party increased by 7.3%. In this framework,
    the CF is equivalent to 2SLS. In the CF, we use the residual (\(\hat{u}\)) of
    the first stage to control for endogeneity in the second stage. Note that the
    residual is statistically significant. Therefore, correction is necessary. We
    can conclude that Table 1 underestimates the impact of financial asset exposure
    on voting for the left party.
