<h1><span class="label">Appendix A. </span>More Python Programming Resources</h1>&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
<p>As this book has hopefully illustrated, Python is a robust and flexible programming language, with a wide range of applications. While I’ve introduced many key concepts and popular libraries in the preceding chapters, I’ve created this appendix to provide you with some helpful resources and references for taking your Python work to the next level.</p>&#13;

<section data-pdf-bookmark="Official Python Documentation" data-type="sect1"><div class="sect1" id="idm45143393523648">&#13;
<h1>Official Python Documentation</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Yes,<a data-primary="Python" data-secondary="official documentation" data-type="indexterm" id="python-official-docs"/><a data-primary="documentation" data-secondary="official Python documentation" data-type="indexterm" id="documentation-official-python"/> there are always search engines and <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/python">StackOverflow</a>, but there’s value in getting comfortable reading official documentation—whether it’s for the Python language or for popular libraries like <code>pandas</code>, <code>matplotlib</code>, or <code>seaborn</code>. Though I wouldn’t suggest you sit down and read <em>any</em> programming documentation end to end, looking through the parameters and options of a data type or function you want to use can give you a better sense of what (in general) can be done with it, as well as an idea of how its mechanisms are organized. This can be especially helpful when you want to do something completely new, because it will give you an idea of where to look for paths forward.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>For example, I knew when I started writing this book that <code>seaborn</code> and <code>pandas</code> were both built on top of <code>matplotlib</code>, and I had done some hacking around with making and customizing graphics with both of them. It wasn’t until I was looking through the latter’s documentation, however, that I came to understand the difference between the <code>figure</code> and <code>axes</code> objects that I so often saw referenced in example code, and that understanding helped me find solutions more quickly as I experimented with ways to more fully customize my visualizations. Almost as important, official documentation is generally kept up to date, while it’s not uncommon for the most popular forum posts about a topic to be months or even years old—meaning that the advice they include can sometimes be woefully out of date.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>I also recommend regularly turning to the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html">Python Standard Library</a> because<a data-primary="Python Standard Library" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45143393512240"/> you might be surprised by how much built-in functionality it offers. Many of the methods you may recognize from working with libraries are built on top of (or to mimic) functions that exist in “vanilla” Python. And while libraries are often unique and useful, there are no guarantees that they will continue to be developed or maintained. If you can get the functionality you need by working with “plain” Python, the less likely it is that you’ll find your code going out of date because it relies on a library that is no longer being <a data-primary="Python" data-secondary="official documentation" data-startref="python-official-docs" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45143393510816"/><a data-primary="documentation" data-secondary="official Python documentation" data-startref="documentation-official-python" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45143393509600"/>updated.</p>&#13;

<h1>Installing Python Resources</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p>There <a data-primary="Python" data-secondary="packages, finding/installing" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45143393506160"/><a data-primary="packages, finding/installing" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45143393505136"/><a data-primary="installing" data-secondary="Python packages" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45143393504448"/>are a lot of ways to install Python packages, depending on your programming environment. Whether you’re using Homebrew on macOS, working on a Windows machine, or using Colab, the most reliable way to install Python packages <a href="https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/installing-packages">will pretty much always be to use some version of <code>pip</code></a>. In fact,<a data-primary="pip command" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45143393502224"/><a data-primary="command line" data-secondary="pip" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45143393501520"/> you can even use <code>pip</code> to install a package on a Google Colab notebook (if you manage to find one that isn’t already installed) <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/snippets/importing_libraries.ipynb">using the following syntax</a>:</p>&#13;
<pre data-type="programlisting">&#13;
!pip install <em>librarynamehere</em>&#13;
</pre>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Whatever you choose, however, I suggest you make your choice and stick to it—things can get pretty unpredictable if you start using multiple tools to install and update your Python environment.</p>&#13;

<h2>Where to Look for Libraries</h2>&#13;
&#13;
<p>For the most<a data-primary="PyPI (Python Package Index)" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45143393495712"/><a data-primary="finding" data-secondary="packages" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45143393494912"/> part, I recommend that you install Python packages that are available on the <a href="https://pypi.org">Python Package Index</a>, also known as PyPI. PyPI has a clean structure and a robust tagging and search interface that make it easy to locate useful Python packages, and the fact that PyPI package documentation (usually) has a standard layout (as shown in <a data-type="xref" href="#pypi_docs_example">Figure A-1</a>) will really start to save you time if you’re looking through lots of options.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Some projects (like Beautiful Soup <code>lxml</code>) may still keep much of their documentation in a standalone location, but their PyPI page will typically still contain a helpful summary of what the project does and even some getting-started tips. One of the things I personally like to look at is the “Release History” section, which shows when the project was first created, as well as how often and how recently the package was updated. Longevity is, of course, not a perfect metric for evaluating how reliable a given package is likely to be—since anyone can publish Python packages (and add them to PyPI)—but the ones that have been around longer and/or are updated more frequently (and recently) are usually a good place to start.</p>&#13;

<h1>Keeping Your Tools Sharp</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Programming tools<a data-primary="Python" data-secondary="updating" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45143393487248"/><a data-primary="Jupyter" data-secondary="updating" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45143393485920"/><a data-primary="updating software tools" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45143393484976"/> are being updated all the time as the community identifies (and mostly fixes) new problems or comes to agree that some aspect of a software tool (or even Python itself!) ought to work differently. If you followed the instructions for installing Python and Jupyter Notebook provided in <a data-type="xref" href="ch01.html#chapter1">Chapter 1</a>, then you can use the <code>conda</code> command to update both of these. You’ll just need to run&#13;
<code>conda update python</code>&#13;
and&#13;
<code>conda update jupyter</code>&#13;
every once in a while. At the same time, because this book is intended for beginners, one thing I didn’t address in <a data-type="xref" href="ch01.html#chapter1">Chapter 1</a> was<a data-primary="Python" data-secondary="environments" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45143393480832"/><a data-primary="environments (Python)" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45143393479856"/> the question of Python <em>environments</em>. In this context, a given <em>environment</em> is defined mostly by the major version of Python that will be used by default (for example, 3.9 versus 3.8) when you use the <code>python</code> command. While running <code>conda update python</code> will update, say, version 3.8.6 to 3.8.11, it <em>won’t</em> ever automatically update your version to a different major release (e.g., 3.9). Often, this won’t cause problems for you unless your Python installation is several years (and therefore major versions) out of date. If and when that happens, you’ll want to create a new environment for the new version of Python, mostly because it can be hard for your computer to keep things straight otherwise. Fortunately, when the time comes for you to upgrade Python to the next major version, you can learn what you need to know about how to do this from the <a href="https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html"><code>conda</code> documentation page</a>.</p>&#13;

<h1>Where to Learn More</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Because <a data-primary="Python" data-secondary="resources for information" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45143393473712"/><a data-primary="resources for information" data-secondary="on Python" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45143393472640"/>Python is such a popular programming language, there are thousands of resources online and in libraries for moving to the next level, whether you have a specific project to complete or just want to learn more about advanced topics like machine learning and natural languages processing.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>For a practical, succinct introduction to more intense data science topics, my first recommendation would be the <a class="orm:hideurl" href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/python-data-science/9781491912126/"><em>Python Data Science Handbook</em></a> by Jake VanderPlas (O’Reilly)—it’s a <a data-primary="Python Data Science Handbook (VanderPlas)" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45143393469584"/>resource I’ve used myself when trying to get my head around some of the more advanced machine-learning work that Python can do, and Jake’s clear writing style and concise examples offer an accessible way to both get an overview of machine learning with Python and learn about specific methods (like k-means clustering). Even better, you can access the <a href="https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook">entire book for free online</a>—though if you’re able to, I highly recommend buying a copy of the book.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Perhaps even <a data-primary="community of Python users" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45143393467232"/>more valuable than finding the right books, tutorials, or classes, however, is finding a community of people whom you can work and learn alongside as you continue your data wrangling journey. Whether through a school, community organization, or meetup, finding a small group of people that you can talk about your projects with or turn to for advice (and, sometimes, commiseration!) is probably the most invaluable resource for expanding your skills in both Python and data wrangling. There are also many cost-free programs that can help support and advance your work, especially for folks from communities that are underrepresented in <a data-primary="Ada Developers Academy" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45143393465648"/><a data-primary="Free Code Camp" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45143393464976"/>technical fields.
