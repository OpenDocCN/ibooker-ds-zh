<h1><span class="label">Part IV. </span>Bilingualism III: Becoming synergistic</h1>

<div class="partintro">
<p>So far in this book we have been exploring the two languages in quite isolated cases. We learned how to learn one from the other, and in which data formats and workflows they excel. In all of those cases the separation has been quite distinct - for some tasks R excels, and in others its general purpose counterpart Python.</p>

<p><em><a data-type="xref" href="ch06.xhtml#ch07">Chapter 6</a></em></p>

<p>In this chapter we’ll take a different perspective - one that can be heralding a new way to work with programming languages in the future.</p>

<p><em><a data-type="xref" href="ch07.xhtml#ch08">Chapter 7</a></em></p>

<p>As a final chapter of the book it is fitting to apply all the concepts we have learned so far. We’ll do this by going through a real world case study of bilingual data science.</p>
