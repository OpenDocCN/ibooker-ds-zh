<h1>Why we wrote this book</h1>

<p>We want to show you why being more aware, informed, and deliberate about your tools is an optimal strategy for increased productivity. With this goal in mind, we didn’t write a bilingual dictionary (well, not <em>only</em>, you’ll find that handy resource in <a data-type="xref" href="app01.xhtml#ap01">Appendix A</a>). On-going discussions about Python vs. R (the so-called “language wars”) have long since ceased to be productive. It recalls, for us, Maslow’s hammer: “if all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail”. It’s a fantasy world-view set in absolutes, where tools offer all-encompassing solutions. Real-world situations are context-dependent, and a craftsperson knows that tools should be chosen appropriately. We aim to showcase a new way of working by taking advantage of all the great data science tools available. Thus we aim to develop both how the modern data scientist thinks and works.</p>

<p>We chose the word modern in the title not just to signify novelty in our approach. It allows us to take a more nuanced stance in how we discuss our tools. What do we mean by <em>modern data science</em>? Modern data science is:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Collective</em>. It does not exist in isolation. It’s integrated into wider networks, such as a team or organization. We avoid jargon when it creates barriers and embrace it when it builds bridges (see <a data-type="xref" href="#tech_int">“Technical interactions”</a>, below).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Simple</em>. We aim to reduce unnecessary complexity in our methods, code &amp; communications.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Accessible</em>. It’s an open design process that can be evaluated, understood and optimized.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Generalizable</em>. Its fundamental tools and concepts are applicable to many domains.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Out-ward looking</em>. It incorporates, is informed and influenced by developments in other fields.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Ethical</em> and <em>honest</em>. It’s people-oriented. It takes best practices for ethical work, as well as a broader view of its consequences, for communities and society, into account. We avoid hype, fads, and trends that only serve short-term gains.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>However the actual job description of a <em>data scientist</em> evolves in the coming years, we can expect that these timeless principles will provide a strong foundation.</p>

<section data-type="sect1" data-pdf-bookmark="Technical interactions"><div class="sect1" id="tech_int">
<h1>Technical interactions</h1>

<p>Accepting that the world is more extensive, more diverse, and more complex than any single tool can serve presents a challenge that is best addressed directly and early.</p>

<p>This broadened perspective results in an increase in <em>technical interactions</em>. We must consider the programming language, packages, naming conventions, project file architecture, integrated development environments (IDEs), text editors, and on and on that will best suit the situation. Diversity gives rise to complexity and confusion.</p>

<p>The more diverse our ecosystem becomes, the more important it is to consider whether our choices act as <em>bridges</em> or <em>barriers</em>. We must always strive to make choices that <em>build bridges</em> with our colleagues and communities and avoid those that <em>build barriers</em> that isolate us and make us inflexible. There is plenty of room to contain all the diversity of choices we’ll encounter. The challenge in each situation is to make choices that balance personal preference and communal accessibility.</p>

<p>This challenge is found in all technical interactions. Aside from tool choice (a “hard” skill), it also includes communication (a “soft” skill). The content, style, and medium of communication, to name just a few considerations, also act as <em>bridges</em> or <em>barriers</em> to a specific audience.</p>

<p>Becoming bilingual in both Python and R is a step towards building bridges among members of the wider data science community.</p>

<section data-type="sect1" data-pdf-bookmark="Who this book is for"><div class="sect1" id="idm45127465819656">
<h1>Who this book is for</h1>

<p>This book aims at data scientists at the intermediate stage of their careers. As such, it doesn’t attempt to <em>teach</em> data science. Nonetheless, early-career data scientists will also benefit from this book by learning what’s possible in a modern data science context before committing to any topic, tool, or language.</p>

<p>Our goal is to bridge the gap between the Python and R communities. We want to move away from a tribal, “us vs. them” mentality and towards a unified, productive community. Thus, this book is for those data scientists who see the benefit of expanding their skillset and thereby their perspectives and the value that their work can add to all variety of data science projects.</p>

<p>It’s negligent to ignore the powerful tools available to us. We strive to be open to new, productive ways of achieving our programming goals and encourage our colleagues to get out of their comfort zone.</p>

<p>In addition, Part I and Appendix A also serve as a useful reference for those moments when you just need to quickly map something familiar in one language onto the other.</p>
</div></section>













<section data-type="sect1" data-pdf-bookmark="Prerequisites"><div class="sect1" id="idm45127465674344">
<h1>Prerequisites</h1>

<p>To obtain the best value from this book, we assume the reader is familiar with at least one of the main programming languages in data science, Python and R. A reader with knowledge of a closely related one, such as Julia or Ruby, can also derive good value.</p>

<p>Basic familiarity with general areas of data science work, such as data munging, data visualization and machine learning is beneficial, but not necessary, to appreciate the examples, workflow scenarios and case study.</p>
</div></section>













<section data-type="sect1" data-pdf-bookmark="How this book is organized"><div class="sect1" id="idm45127465671944">
<h1>How this book is organized</h1>

<p>We’ve organized this book as if we’re learning a second spoken language as an adult.</p>

<p>In <a data-type="xref" href="part01.xhtml#p01">Part I</a> we begin by going back in time to the origins of the two languages and then showing how that has influenced the current state by covering key breakthroughs. If you want to get right into the languages, skip straight to <a data-type="xref" href="part02.xhtml#p02">Part II</a>.</p>

<p>In our analogy with spoken languages this helps provide a bit of context as to why there are quirks such as irregular verbs and plural endings. Etymology<sup><a data-type="noteref" id="idm45127465667224-marker" href="preface01.xhtml#idm45127465667224">1</a></sup> is interesting and helps you gain an appreciation of a language, like the seemingly endless forms of plural nouns in German, but it’s certainly not essential for speaking.</p>

<p><a data-type="xref" href="part02.xhtml#p02">Part II</a> provides a deeper dive into the dialects of both languages, by offering a mirrored perspective. First we will cover how a Python user should approach work with R, and then the other way around. Not only will this expand your skill set, but also your way of thinking as you appreciate how each language operates.</p>

<p>In this part, we’ll treat each language separately as we start to become bilingual. Just like becoming bilingual in a spoken language, we need to resist two defeating urges. The first urge is to point out how much more straightforward, or more elegant, or in some way “better”, something is in our mother tongue. Congratulations to you, but that’s not the point of learning a new language, is it? We’re going to learn each language in its own right. Although we’ll point out comparisons as we go along, they’ll help us deal with our native-language baggage.</p>

<p>The second urge is to constantly try to interpret <em>literally</em> and <em>word-for-word</em> between two languages. This prevents us from <em>thinking</em> (or even <em>dreaming</em>) in the new language and sometimes it’s just not possible! Examples I like to use are phrasing such as <em>das schmeckt mir</em> in German, or <em>ho fame</em> in Italian which translate literally very poorly as <em>that tastes to me</em> (“That tastes good”) and <em>I have hunger</em> (“I’m hungry”). The point is, different languages allow for different constructs. This gives us new tools to work with and new ways to think, once we realize that we can’t map everything 1-to-1 onto our previous knowledge. Think of these chapters as our first step to mapping your knowledge of one language onto the other.</p>

<p><a data-type="xref" href="part03.xhtml#p03">Part III</a> covers the modern context of language applications. This includes a review of the broad ecosystem of open-source packages as well as the variety of workflow-specific methods. This part will demonstrate when one language is preferred and why, although they’ll still be separate languages at this point. This will help you to decide which language to use for parts of a large data science project.</p>

<p>In spoken languages, <em>lost in translation</em> is a real thing. Some things just work better in one language. In German, <em>mir ist heiß</em> and <em>ich bin heiß</em> are both <em>I’m hot</em> in English; but a German-speaker will distinguish hotness from the weather versus physique. Other words like <em>Schadenfreude</em>, a compound word from “Schaden” (damage) and “Freude” (pleasure) meaning to take pleasure in someone’s difficulties, or <em>Kummerspeck</em>, a compound word from “Kummer” (greif) and “Speck” (bacon) referring to the weight gained due to emotional eating, are just so perfect there’s no use in translating them.</p>

<p><a data-type="xref" href="part04.xhtml#p04">Part IV</a> details the modern interfaces that exist between the languages. First, we became bilingual, using each language in isolation. Then, we identified how to choose one language over another. Now, we’ll explore tools that take us from separate and interconnected Python and R scripts to single scripts that weave the two languages together in a single workflow.</p>

<p>The real fun starts when you’re not just bilingual, but working within a bilingual community. Not only can you communicate in each language independently, but you can also combine them in novel ways that only other bilingual speakers will appreciate and understand. Bilingualism doesn’t just provide access to a new community, but creates in itself a new community. For purists, this is pure torture, but I hope we’ve moved beyond that. Bilinguals can appreciate the warning “The <em>Ordnungsamt</em> is monitoring <em>Bergmannkiez</em> today”. Ideally you’re not substituting words because you’ve forgotten them, but because it’s the best choice for the situation. There’s no great translation of <em>Orgnungsamt</em> (regulatory agency?) and Bergmannkiez is a neighborhood in Berlin that shouldn’t be translated anyways. Sometimes words in one language more easily convey a message, like <em>Mundschutzpflicht</em>, the obligatory wearing of face masks during the Coronavirus pandemic.</p>

<p>Finally, <a data-type="xref" href="ch07.xhtml#ch08">Chapter 7</a> consists of a case study that will outline how a modern data science project can be implemented based on the material covered in this book. Here, we’ll see all the previous sections come together in one workflow.</p>
