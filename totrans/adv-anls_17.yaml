    to advance into further areas of analytics. To end this leg of your analytics
    journey, I’d like to share some topics to help round out and expand upon what
    you now know.

    databases, and BI tools. Because of our focus on the statistically based elements
    of analytics, we emphasized the first two slices of the stack. Refer back to that
    chapter on ideas for how the other slices tie in, and what to learn about them.'

    analysis can only follow from sound data *collection*: as the saying goes, “garbage
    in, garbage out.” In this book, we’ve assumed our data was collected accurately,
    was the right data for our analysis, and contained a representative sample. And
    we’ve been working with well-known datasets often taken from peer-reviewed research,
    so this is a safe assumption.'

    *and* analyzing it. It’s worth learning more, then, about research *design* and
    *methods*. This field can get quite sophisticated and academic, but it’s found
    practical applications in the field of business experiments. Check out Stefan
    H. Thomke’s *Experimentation Works: The Surprising Power of Business Experiments*

    research methods to business.'

    2nd Edition (O’Reilly) by Peter Bruce et al. to apply them using R and Python.
    As its title suggests, the latter book straddles the line between statistics and
    data science.

    Then there’s the difference between *proposal-final.txt* and *proposal-FINAL-final.txt*
    to contend with. It can be quite difficult to sort out which is the “main” copy,
    and how to reconstruct and migrate all changes to that copy while keeping a record
    of who contributed what.

- en: A *version control system* can come to the rescue here. This is a way to track
    projects over time, such as the contributions and changes made by different users.
    Version control is a game changer for collaboration and tracking revisions but
    has a relatively steep learning curve.

- en: Git is a dominant version control system that is quite popular among data scientists,
    software engineers, and other technical professionals. In particular, they often
    use the cloud-based hosting service GitHub to manage Git projects. For an overview
    of Git and GitHub, check out [*Version Control with Git*](https://oreil.ly/SV0Xq),
    2nd edition by Jon Loeliger and Matthew McCullough (O’Reilly). For a look at how
    to pair Git and GitHub with R and RStudio, check out the online resource [*Happy
    Git and GitHub for the useR*](https://happygitwithr.com) by Jenny Bryan et al.
    At this time Git and other version control systems are relatively uncommon in
    data analytics workflows, but they are growing in popularity due in part to the
    growing demand for reproducibility.

    by ethical concerns. In [Chapter 3](ch03.html#foundations-of-inference) you learned
    about statistical bias: especially in a machine learning context, it’s possible
    that a model could begin to discriminate against groups of people in unjust or
    illegal ways. If data is being collected about individuals, consideration should
    be given to those individuals’ privacy and consent.'

    and trending popularity. My answer: take some time to find out what you like,
    and let those interests shape your learning path rather than trying to tailor
    it toward the “next big thing” in analytics tools. These skills are *all* valuable.
    More important than any one analytics tool is the ability to contextualize and
    pair those tools, which requires exposure to a broad set of applications. But
    you can’t become an expert in everything. The best learning strategy will resemble
    a “T” shape: a wide exposure to various data tools, with relatively deeper knowledge
    in a handful of them.'
