<p>Does the following scenario sound familiar? You’ve just received a data request from a department in your organization, and you have no idea how to handle it or perhaps even exactly what you’ve been asked to do. Outside the structured experience of your initial training, the real world is messy and uncertain. You may be wondering</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li class="readable-text" id="p6"> How do you use your existing skills to complete projects for demanding stakeholders? </li>
<li class="readable-text" id="p7"> How do you keep learning now that the structured training environment is no longer there? </li>
<li class="readable-text" id="p8"> How can you apply your general skills to domain-specific tasks? </li>
<li class="readable-text" id="p9"> What do you need to learn next? </li>
</ul>
<div class="readable-text" id="p10">
<p>Any senior data scientist will tell you that the answer to all these questions is “experience.” By completing the eight projects in this book, you will accelerate the process of getting the experience you need to succeed as a data analyst.</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p11">
<p>You will hone your existing skills and learn new ones by completing projects similar to those you may encounter in the real world. As you go, you will do most of the work, but ideas will be provided to get you started. To augment the specific skills, I also lay out an approach to make you a better analyst by focusing on pragmatic results. Along the way, you’ll follow a process to make it easier to learn new skills efficiently and to get the most value out of each new challenge you face.</p>

</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p13">
<p>There are certain fundamental skills analysts learn at the start of their journeys and bring to their roles. These are the ability to</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li class="readable-text" id="p14"> Read in (load) a dataset from a variety of sources </li>
<li class="readable-text" id="p15"> Join datasets together </li>
<li class="readable-text" id="p16"> Manipulate columns by creating, deleting, renaming, and transforming them </li>
<li class="readable-text" id="p17"> Perform basic statistical analysis, such as calculating averages </li>
<li class="readable-text" id="p18"> Explore your data using visualizations such as bar charts, line charts, or scatter plots </li>
<li class="readable-text" id="p19"> Present your findings by creating appropriate visualizations or designing dashboards </li>
</ul>
<div class="readable-text" id="p20">
<p>Which tool you find comfortable using for these tasks does not matter. Appropriate tools include</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li class="readable-text" id="p21"> Microsoft Excel (or equivalent) </li>
<li class="readable-text" id="p22"> Business intelligence (BI) tools, such as Tableau or Power BI </li>
<li class="readable-text" id="p23"> Database query languages such as SQL, although these typically don’t have visualization capabilities </li>
<li class="readable-text" id="p24"> Programming languages with data analysis capabilities, such as Python or R </li>
</ul>
<div class="readable-text" id="p25">
<p>The example solutions to the projects are provided in Python, but the focus will be on problem solving, not the specifics of the Python programming language.</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p26">
<p>Completing the projects will build on your foundational skill set by adding skills specific to real-world use cases, which include data modeling, working with categorical data, extracting data from unusual sources, and rapid prototyping. In each case, I will highlight the exact kind of functionality required to solve the problem so that you can find the appropriate way to do that with your preferred tool. Some of the projects use machine learning models, but in-depth discussions about machine learning are beyond the scope of our projects.</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p27">
<p>The projects will also let you hone more “meta-skills,” which are vital for any data analysis project. These skills are the ability to</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li class="readable-text" id="p28"> Take a human question, one that is vague and contains no technical jargon, and translate it into one that can be answered with data </li>
<li class="readable-text" id="p29"> Evaluate the available data and determine whether it’s suitable for answering the question </li>
<li class="readable-text" id="p30"> Know how to pivot your analysis and change your analytical question if it cannot be answered with the available data </li>
<li class="readable-text" id="p31"> Communicate your results to someone with no knowledge, or even interest, in the technical details </li>
</ul>
<div class="readable-text print-book-callout" id="p32">
<p><span class="print-book-callout-head">NOTE</span>  The practice projects focus on building technical and problem-solving skills, but there are other professional skills needed for a good data analyst. If you want a deeper dive into these, I recommend <em>Build a Career in Data Science</em> by Robinson and Nolis (Manning, 2020).</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p33">
<p>The future of data analysis also includes artificial intelligence (AI) tools, such as ChatGPT and similar large language models. AI tools cannot replace your ability to think critically, communicate with stakeholders, or work within the constraints of your business environment; however, AI tools can accelerate your work by helping you automate the more mechanical aspects of a project. I will highlight instances where such a tool could help solve a part of your problem. For example, if you don’t know how to read data from a PDF file, an AI model will be able to tell you how to access this functionality in your preferred tool and give you code snippets to use. This means that you can solve that particular subproblem faster, which will make you more productive.</p>

<div class="callout-container sidebar-container">
<div class="readable-text" id="p34">
<h5 class="callout-container-h5 readable-text-h5 sigil_not_in_toc">A note on terminology </h5>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p35">
<p>I use the terms “data science” and “data analysis” interchangeably. First and foremost, data scientists need to be good analysts, so I prefer to use the phrase “analysis” instead of “data science” to describe the discipline and “analyst” instead of “data scientist” when describing the practitioner. When I use “data science,” I just mean “the process of analyzing data.”</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p36">
<p>I also refer to the “real world” a lot. The reason for this is to emphasize the disconnect between what you learn in a classroom versus what an analyst job looks like in practice. This disconnect doesn’t mean classrooms are bad; there are simply multiple, not necessarily technical, hurdles to overcome that cannot be taught in a classroom. My focus is on preparing junior analysts for their jobs by teaching them all the things they couldn’t have learned in their formal training. When I say, “real world,” I mean “outside a learning environment.”</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p37">
<p>Similarly, the word “stakeholder” is also a loaded term. I will use it to mean your boss, an internal client, or an external customer. They are the originators of the requests that generate the work you do. A stakeholder is anyone who is the target audience of your analysis and will be directly affected by your work.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p38">
<h2 class="readable-text-h2" id="sigil_toc_id_6"><span class="num-string">1.2</span> A results-driven approach</h2>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p39">
<p>On the job, your success depends far more on the results you deliver than the skills and knowledge you bring to a task. Being results oriented means your focus is always on problem solving. You should arrive at a first draft solution as soon as possible—something I like to call the <em>minimum viable answer</em>. This is what you present to your stakeholders and what is used as the basis for future iterations. Applying this thinking streamlines your work and delivers immediate value. You spend time learning something that will be immediately applicable, getting a higher return on the time you invest. With this results-focused approach, you do not need to be an expert in everything up front; instead, by completing each project, you will add new, specific skills to your toolbox and learn a method for approaching new tasks efficiently as you go. The results-driven approach I present means practicing learning by doing and working in a results-focused way.</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p40">
<p>Let’s look at this approach through the lens of a classic example from industry. Suppose you work for a car dealership and need to answer the seemingly simple question, “How many cars did we sell yesterday?” for your manager. In an ideal world, this is a simple business intelligence question that requires nothing more than filtering a sales table down to just cars sold yesterday and providing an answer. The reality is that we need to think deeper about the problem, starting with defining the terms before we begin.</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p41">
<p>A results-driven analytical method to solve such a problem looks like this:</p>
</div>
<ol>
<li class="readable-text" id="p42"> <em>Understand</em> <em>the problem </em>—This includes definitions of individual words/concepts. </li>
<li class="readable-text" id="p43"> <em>Start at the end </em>—What is a minimum viable answer that could spark further conversation? </li>
<li class="readable-text" id="p44"> <em>Identify</em> <em>additional resources </em>—These can be data, people, or access permissions you need to get this minimum viable answer. </li>
<li class="readable-text" id="p45"> <em>Obtain</em> <em>the data you will need to get your minimum viable answer </em>—Does this data even exist? </li>
<li class="readable-text" id="p46"> <em>Do</em> <em>the work to get your minimum viable answer </em>—Ideally, this step shouldn’t take more than a few days so you can iterate quickly. </li>
<li class="readable-text" id="p47"> <em>Present</em> <em>the minimum viable answer to a stakeholder </em>—This could be anything from a casual conversation to a presentation to an audience. </li>
<li class="readable-text" id="p48"> <em>Iterate if necessary </em>—If the work is valuable, stakeholders will ask you to pursue it further. </li>
</ol>
<div class="readable-text" id="p49">
<p>Figure 1.1 is a visual representation of this process. Notice the arrows going back from step 7: they highlight the nonlinearity of the process. Depending on how step 6 goes, you might need to go back to an earlier step, even as far back as the very beginning.<span class="aframe-location"/></p>

<div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p51">
<p>The icons in figure 1.1 will be used throughout the book when discussing how this approach can be applied to specific projects. To apply this process to our car example, we start with step 1, “Understand the problem.”</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p52">
<h3 class="readable-text-h3" id="sigil_toc_id_7"><span class="num-string">1.2.1</span> Understand the problem</h3>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p53">
<p>What do we mean by “car”? When I worked in the automotive industry, every time a question about vehicles came up, we would have to clarify whether that included vans or other vehicles that weren’t quite cars. Sometimes vans were relevant, sometimes they weren’t. Then, what do we mean by “yesterday”? Often, several dates could be associated with a sale event: the day the customer bought an item in a store, the day we invoiced a customer for an item, the day the customer paid, or even the date a sale-related dispute was resolved. So, when we ask about “yesterday,” we need to know which date column to use. Even the word “sell” can be ambiguous. What if a customer returns an item later? Does that mean the answer to this question changes over time? We might explicitly decide that what happened in the past isn’t fixed, which will make our analyses more complicated. Incidentally, we should codify answers to these kinds of questions and record them in business-specific data models. More on this in chapter 3.</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p54">
<p>The output of this step should be</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li class="readable-text" id="p55"> A clear question that can be tackled with an analysis </li>
<li class="readable-text" id="p56"> A defined scope (e.g., does the analysis of cars also extend to vans?) </li>
<li class="readable-text" id="p57"> Clearly defined terminology agreed on by those involved </li>
</ul>
<div class="readable-text" id="p58">
<p>These items should be documented as part of the project for transparency and reproducibility. Once we have understood the requirements, we should move on to envisaging a solution.</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p59">
<h3 class="readable-text-h3" id="sigil_toc_id_8"><span class="num-string">1.2.2</span> Start at the end</h3>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p60">
<p>Assuming we have agreed on terminology, we can start at the end and decide what a minimum viable answer looks like. This depends on the nature of the request and what our stakeholders want to do with the information. If it’s a quick ballpark estimate they need, we can sidestep some of those difficult questions about vehicle types and dates unless we have a good data model to pull from. Knowing what level of answer our stakeholder expects is crucial to deciding how much effort the request warrants.</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p61">
<p>The output of this step is a clear picture of what an acceptable solution looks like. Is it a document, a presentation, or even a working proof of concept? Once this is understood, the next step is to identify the required data.</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p62">
<h3 class="readable-text-h3" id="sigil_toc_id_9"><span class="num-string">1.2.3</span> Identify additional resources</h3>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p63">
<p>Even for simple requests, it is important to ask, “What data would we need to answer this question?” immediately followed by “Do we have this data?” It is advisable to research the available data before committing to any work because there are cases where we just don’t have a dataset that directly records the concept we’re interested in. For example, in an online auction marketplace, sales transactions might not be recorded directly as they could take place outside the system. We would need to know where a record is made if a sale is agreed over the phone after the auction takes place.</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p64">
<p>The output should be a list of what the appropriate data might look like to answer the question. This should include possible datasets already available to the organization and external datasets that will need to be obtained.</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p65">
<h3 class="readable-text-h3" id="sigil_toc_id_10"><span class="num-string">1.2.4</span> Obtain the data</h3>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p66">
<p>Now, we need to obtain the relevant data, either by extracting it from somewhere or by creating it. If our online auction marketplace is only used for listing and bidding, we might have to make do with inferring when something was sold by seeing when it stopped being listed. This is a dataset we would need to create from the raw listing data. In this case, we would have to stop at step 3 and regroup to figure out whether creating such an inferred sales dataset is worth the effort. This will depend on the minimum viable answer we defined in step 2.</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p67">
<p>The output should be a tangible dataset or extract, which we can use to get to our minimum viable answer. If the data is only an extract, it should be representative of the larger data.</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p68">
<h3 class="readable-text-h3" id="sigil_toc_id_11"><span class="num-string">1.2.5</span> Do the work</h3>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p69">
<p>You will notice that step 5 just says “Do the work.” This is intentionally broad and vague. Step 5 might encompass the entirety of other data analysis workflows you may have encountered. Steps 1–4 ensure that the doing part will have a higher ROI. By this point, you’ve given the problem enough thought that you’re not just aimlessly jumping into writing code, which is certainly a temptation when your skills are fresh and you’re eager to deliver. I encourage you to spend time on steps 1–4, perhaps even more than you instinctively would.</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p70">
<p>In the car example, during this phase, you might find that the sale date of a vehicle changes over time based on events such as a customer waiting for a finance agreement to come through, or previously undisclosed faults were subsequently noticed, and the customer raised a complaint. You as the analyst should not be making the decision alone about which possible date constitutes the actual sale date. Here, you would go all the way back to step 1 to have a conversation with your stakeholders before continuing your analysis.</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p71">
<p>Whatever happens in the analysis, documenting your specific choices and assumptions is critical for transparency and reproducibility. In the example solutions presented for each project, I have documented the specific choices I made and where another analyst’s path might have diverged had they made different decisions.</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p72">
<p>The output here is whatever was decided in step 2, “Start at the end.” This artifact should be recorded as part of the project and be reproducible by other analysts. Chapters 12 and 13 present a project where we do just that.</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p73">
<h3 class="readable-text-h3" id="sigil_toc_id_12"><span class="num-string">1.2.6</span> Present the minimum viable answer</h3>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p74">
<p>A key component of the results-driven approach is presenting results earlier than we might be inclined to. We are looking for a satisfactory solution, so we should be discussing preliminary results as early as possible to allow iteration. Data teams have failed in the past when they siloed themselves away from the rest of the business, only to emerge months later with work that no one asked for and has no tangible business value.</p>
</div>
<div class="callout-container sidebar-container">
<div class="readable-text" id="p75">
<h5 class="callout-container-h5 readable-text-h5 sigil_not_in_toc">Is anyone using your work?</h5>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p76">
<p>I once sat through an interesting presentation at a conference where the data science team had built a complicated sales forecasting model. The presentation was purely technical and told the story of how they arrived at their hierarchical Bayesian approach.</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p77">
<p>In the Q&amp;A portion, I asked the difficult question: “Does anyone use your forecasts, and if so, what for?” The data scientists sheepishly admitted that they’re still working on convincing the business that their forecasts are worthwhile. I suspect a lot of needless work could have been avoided had they engaged in that conversation sooner.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p78">
<p>The output of this step is minutes of a meeting with, or presentation to, our stakeholders. The outcomes should also be recorded as part of the project. Was further work requested? If so, what?</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p79">
<h3 class="readable-text-h3" id="sigil_toc_id_13"><span class="num-string">1.2.7</span> Iterate if necessary</h3>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p80">
<p>Finally, you will almost always end up iterating your first answer. It is an important step to include in any data analysis framework because it highlights the inherent uncertainty of the job. You will never have all the answers up front, including an answer to the question “How long will this analysis take?” and that’s fine. Accept that a first draft will be necessary to reach a satisfying solution, and the sooner that first draft exists, the better. The added benefit of this iterative approach is that you become better at estimating how long your work will take because you only ever have to estimate one iteration rather than the entire project.</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p81">
<p>Using a results-driven approach, you will develop an intuition for how to make analytical decisions that help you focus on providing a pragmatic solution rather than an unnecessarily deep answer up front. Of course, you will need to learn new tools along the way. Sometimes, these tools will only be used for the analysis you have in front of you. The next analysis may need different tools. That’s okay—tools come and go, but the knowledge and concepts you learn will remain the same, and these are what make a good analyst.</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p82">
<p>It is important to note that this approach is not a substitute for going deep when necessary. I’m not encouraging anyone to learn to take shortcuts. However, a key skill in analytics is identifying the highest ROI on your time, which often means adopting a breadth-first rather than depth-first approach.</p>

<h2 class="readable-text-h2" id="sigil_toc_id_14"><span class="num-string">1.3</span> Project structure</h2>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p84">
<p>The projects are designed to represent common problems faced by analysts in industry. Each project is designed to be approachable with fundamental analyst skills and not take too long. There are a lot of factors at play: your level of experience with your tools, your familiarity with the topics at hand, the speed at which you learn new concepts, and so on, but generally, the first iteration of your solution to each project should take somewhere between 2 hours and two days. That’s a broad range, but even a two-day “sprint” to deliver something you can discuss with a stakeholder would be considered a quick turnaround time.</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p85">
<p>The projects not only reflect common industry problems but are also designed to bridge specific skill gaps between initial training and the real world. Table 1.1 is an overview of these projects.</p>
