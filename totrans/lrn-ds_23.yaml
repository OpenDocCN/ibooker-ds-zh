- en: Donkeys play important roles in rural Kenya. People need them to transport crops,
    water, and people and to plow fields. When a donkey gets sick, the veterinarian
    needs to figure out how much the donkey weighs in order to prescribe the right
    amount of medicine. But many vets in rural Kenya don’t have access to a scale,
    so they need to guess the donkey’s weight. Too little medicine can allow an infection
    to reemerge; too much medicine can cause a harmful overdose. There are over 1.8
    million donkeys in Kenya, so it’s important to have a simple, accurate way to
    estimate the weight of a donkey.

    to create a model that veterinarians in the Kenyan countryside can use to make
    accurate estimates of a donkey’s weight. As usual, we walk through the steps of
    the data science lifecycle, but this time our work departs from the basics covered
    so far in this book. You can think of this case study as an opportunity to reflect
    on many of the core principles of working with data and to understand how they
    can be extended to address the context of the situation. We directly evaluate
    sources of measurement error, design a special loss function that reflects the
    concern about an overdose, build a model while keeping applicability top of mind,
    and evaluate model predictions using special criteria that are relative to the
    donkey’s size.

    a donkey when they’re out in the countryside without a scale? Let’s think about
    the information that is more readily available to them. They can carry a tape
    measure and find the size of the donkey in other dimensions, like its height.
    They can observe the animal’s sex, assess its general condition, and inquire about
    the donkey’s age. So we can refine our question to: how can a vet accurately predict
    the weight of a donkey from easy-to-get measurements?'

    two donkeys in our analysis. We have only one donkey in each of these extreme
    categories, so our model might well not extend to donkeys with a BCS of 1 or 4.5\.
    We remove these two records from the dataframe and note that our analysis may
    not extend to emaciated or obese donkeys. In general, we exercise caution in dropping
    records from a dataframe. Later, we may also decide to remove the five donkeys
    with a score of 1.5 if they appear anomalous in our analysis, but for now, we
    keep them in our dataframe. In general, we need a good reason to exclude data,
    and we should document these actions since they can impact our findings. Removing
    data can lead to over fitting, if we drop any record that disagrees with the model.

    few data points ([Chapter 11](ch11.html#ch-viz)). It appears that the median weight
    increases with the body condition score, but not in a simple linear fashion. On
    the other hand, weight distributions for the three sex categories appear roughly
    the same. As for age, once a donkey reaches five years, the distribution of weight
    doesn’t seem to change much. But donkeys under age 2 and donkeys from 2 to 5 years
    of age have lower weights in general.

    inference, and prediction. For description, we sought a simple, understandable
    model. We handcrafted this model, beginning with our findings from the exploratory
    phase of the analysis. Every action we took to include a feature in the model,
    collapse categories, or transform a feature amounts to a decision we made while
    investigating the data.'

    make use of physical and statistical models. In this case, the physical model
    is the representation of a donkey by a cylinder. An inquisitive reader might have
    pointed out that we could have used this representation directly to estimate the
    weight of a donkey (cylinder) from its length and girth (since girth is <math><mn>2</mn>

- en: Given this physical model, you might wonder why we did not use logarithmic or
    square transformations in fitting our model. We leave you to investigate such
    a model in greater detail. But generally, if the range of values measured is small,
    then the log function is roughly linear. To keep our model simple, we chose not
    to make these transformations given the strength of the statistical model seen
    by the high correlation between girth and weight.

- en: We did a lot of *data dredging* in this modeling exercise. We examined all possible
    models built from linear combinations of the numeric features, and we examined
    coefficients of dummy variables to decide whether to collapse categories. When
    we create models using an iterative approach like this, it is extremely important
    that we set aside data to assess the model. Evaluating the model on new data reassures
    us that the model we chose works well. The data that we set aside did not enter
    into any decision making when building the model, so it gives us a good sense
    of how well the model works for making predictions.

    mind. Our model has done well on the test set, but the test and train sets come
    from the same data collection process. We expect our model to work well in practice
    as long as the scope remains the same for new data.

    simplicity and complexity and between physical and statistical models. A physical
    model can be a good starting point in modeling, and a statistical model can inform
    a physical model. As data scientists, we needed to make judgment calls at each
    step in the analysis. Modeling is both an art and a science.
