    psychology tells us that personality changes in predictable ways over someone’s
    lifetime. On the other side of the spectrum, an urban planner looking decades
    in the future may want to take into account not only gradual changes in lifestyle
    habits, but also potential divergences whereby the direction of these changes

    a necessary nor a sufficient reason to buy a red Corvette. In fact, both causal

    contribution of age to existential qualms depends a lot on social patterns such
    as professional and family trajectories (e.g., the age at which someone enters
    the labor market or has their first child, assuming they do either one), and resolving

    (of which they are a contributing factor) that are more psychological and actionable
    in nature. For example, law enforcement and nursing are still overwhelmingly gendered
    fields in the US and many other countries. Noting that empirical regularity is
    unlikely to earn you any pat on the back. A much more interesting question is
    how that effect happens. For instance, one hypothesis would be that it stems from
    social representations and norms about authority and care. Alternatively, one
    could posit that this phenomenon is self-perpetuating because of the lack of alternative
    role models. Determining which hypothesis is true (or which has more weight if

    if you’re working on a wellness app and you want to make sure that people stay
    on track with their program, you’ll need to be much more granular than that. I
    once attended a presentation by behavioral scientist Steve Wendel in which he
    walked the audience through “going to the gym” step by step (putting on gym clothes,
    going to the car, deciding what exercise to do once at the gym, and so on). This
    is the level of detail you’ll often need to employ if you are attempting to identify
    and resolve behavioral blockers. The same would apply to a customer journey on

    a significant share of new customers cancel their account in their first month.
    Thus AirCnC’s daily cancel rate may spike alarmingly during the month following
    the campaign, even though nothing went wrong. A good rule of thumb is that sound
    aggregate variables are based on sound individual variables. If a variable makes
    sense only in the aggregate and doesn’t have a meaningful interpretation at the
    individual level, that’s a red flag. In our example, a meaningful individual counterpart
    to the cancellation rate would be the cancellation probability. When controlling

    remain stable despite the influx of new customers.

    the call center. These would look different to someone watching the customer in

    analyses that call for using the binary variable *ChangedBillingInformation*.

    two bookings per year. However, one year they take their winter vacation in January
    instead of December. We would count one vacation in the earlier year and three
    in the latter even though behaviors didn’t really change. Such catch-up phenomena—longer
