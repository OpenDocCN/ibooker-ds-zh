<h1>Preface</h1>
<p><em>Python for Geospatial Data Analysis</em> is an introduction to geospatial data analysis using a selection of Python libraries and packages, optimized for exploration and discovery. In recent years, as the Internet of Things has arisen and location data has become available on local computers, professionals in a wide range of fields have been exploring geospatial platforms with built-in analytics—geospatial professionals, data scientists, business analysts, geographers, geologists, researchers, analysts, computer scientists, and statistics professionals, to name just a few. As they explore, these learners often seek to gain a deeper appreciation of the technology embedded in their tools. Graphical user interfaces are powerful, but you can truly elevate your skill set by writing your own Python code to fully customize or automate the outcome and by gaining a better grasp of how large platforms and systems work.</p>
<p>Open source projects look to engage a wide variety of users; today, professionals in most industries likely have access to location data and publicly available datasets. Advances in cloud computing no longer require massive downloads to local computers, meaning that access has been democratized to anyone with an internet-enabled device. This book aims to be a resource that meets professionals wherever they are and serves as a guide to their goals and understanding. This book encourages readers of all backgrounds to engage in geospatial analysis to help inform decision making in urban planning, climate change research, and many other fields.</p>
<p>Even for experienced data analysts, technology is often siloed. You may know a bit of Python and can jump in and out of QGIS or ArcGIS without really needing to know operationalized workflows. You can certainly work with embedded systems without appreciating raster, vector, or mathematical models, but understanding these foundational elements will bring a new level of rigor and inquiry to your exploratory and explanatory data competency.</p>
<p>How did I end up writing a book about geospatial analytics and Python integration? I had a problem to solve. In conducting analysis on electronic health records, I found that they incorporated plenty of medical data but only vaguely useful demographic information. Examining this aspect of the built infrastructure of health care revealed to me the importance of location in predicting health outcomes. We can’t make policy decisions about public health without knowing the answers to questions like:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Do patients’ neighborhoods offer fresh markets within walking distance or along accessible transportation lines?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are patients’ neighborhoods walkable and safe?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do patients have access to green spaces?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How does proximity to highways, power lines, and waste-treatment plants, for example, influence the health of nearby neighborhoods?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And how can we bring location data into studying these environments?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Integrating these types of nonspatial data with spatial information allows you to explore your surroundings—or any other place on the Earth’s surface that interests you—and generate maps and other visualizations that can help you think through complex questions.</p>
<section data-pdf-bookmark="Why Python?" data-type="sect1"><div class="sect1" id="why_pythonquestion_mark">
<h1>Why Python?</h1>
<p>Python is a popular, nimble scripting language. Its accessible coding syntax makes it easier to learn than most programming languages, so you can start using it relatively quickly. Python is great for geospatial data analysis because it has already been incorporated into many geographic information system (GIS) applications, including ArcGIS and QGIS. It also has the support of a vibrant open source community with an abundance of libraries and packages.</p>
<p>This is <em>not</em> a Python 101 book. If you’re a beginner looking for a basic grounding in the language, there are many resources available to you. You might want to start with <em>Pandas 1.x Cookbook,</em> second edition, by Matt Harrison and Theodore Petrou (Packt Publishing), or any of the in-person or online courses by Dunder Data, such as <a href="https://oreil.ly/swed0"><em>Master the Fundamentals of Python</em></a><em>.</em></p>
<p>Perhaps you don’t have the inclination or time to learn an entire programming language. Although I recommend having at least one computer language in your toolbox, that’s OK. The purpose of this book is to get you up and running with the extensive ecosystem of publicly available geospatial data, and total programming competence is not required. I provide step-by-step guidance along with the code snippets throughout the book. I direct you to resources on a variety of additional functions not covered in this book so that you can take what you learn and use it to explore. As you become comfortable working with one or two functions in a large library or package, you will gain confidence to expand into new areas.</p>

<section data-pdf-bookmark="How This Book Works" data-type="sect1"><div class="sect1" id="how_this_book_works">
<h1>How This Book Works</h1>
<p>We will begin with a quick level set introducing you to a few key GIS concepts. As we advance, I’ll slowly integrate Python learning. I do not assume expertise in a coding language or in geospatial analytics.</p>
<p>The resources presented here are open source: their source code is distributed freely by the developers and usually incorporates contributions from community members. Most make use of Python. To the best of my ability, I’ve ensured that this book features resources available without burdensome subscription services. Any costs, however modest, are highlighted so that you can make informed decisions. My focus on open source doesn’t mean that I don’t support enterprise solutions; it means I want to lower the barriers to conducting meaningful analysis around big questions.</p>
<p>This book covers a wide swath of open source tools and data and looks at a variety of datasets, some of which you perhaps don’t have access to in your current professional role. <em>Python for Geospatial Data Analysis</em> is not linear like typical books about technology (or, for that matter, about Python). There are multiple ways to explore data problems. Perhaps you can draw inspiration from working in an integrated development environment (IDE) for the first time. Maybe you’re curious about working in a terminal or console.</p>
<p>It is impossible to walk through the granular details of each Python package or library in a single book. If you’re familiar with a particular tool or library, you probably have favorite features that I haven’t included here. That’s fine—I just want to give you a feel for each one. From there, you can continue discovering what they have to offer.</p>

<section data-pdf-bookmark="Who Is This Book For?" data-type="sect1"><div class="sect1" id="who_is_this_book_forquestion_mark">
<h1>Who Is This Book For?</h1>
<p>My vision for <em>Python for Geospatial Data Analysis</em> presented me with a conundrum: how do you write a book for newly minted geospatial professionals who know Python <em>and</em> for newly minted Python programmers who are well versed in geospatial analytics? I decided simply to make it interesting. My goal isn’t to grant you professional expertise at either end of the spectrum but to bring us all together to learn tools and best practices.</p>
<p>By the end of this book, I want all of you to feel proficient and confident enough to go out and explore geospatial analytics on your own. To that end, as I teach each tool and technique, I ask you to follow along, installing the tools as needed and using a Jupyter or Google Colab notebook to run code. But I don’t want you to stop there, so I also provide a host of different experiences that invite you to continue to explore.</p>

<h1>A Few Tips on Tooling</h1>
<p>There is no such thing as infallible code. You are going to need to learn how to troubleshoot. That is why the data goddess invented <a href="https://stackoverflow.com">Stack Overflow</a>. A quick warning—you don’t always get the best or most correct solutions from advice sites, so research with caution. To help, I have selected Python packages with a solid GitHub presence to ensure that support is always an option. Having said that, I’ll offer a few tips you may find helpful as you install and get acquainted with the tools in this book:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Create Python environments when possible so that you can control versions and dependencies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you aren’t in a Conda or Mamba environment, always check your versions of Python and any other software or packages. Version issues are the biggest generator of error codes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not sure if your pip install worked? Write <code><strong>!pip list</strong></code> in a cell and run it. All packages installed in that session will be included in the list.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don’t be afraid of package documentation! Reading the instructional materials is an important part of acquiring new skills and is key to troubleshooting.</p>

</ul>

<h1>Finding Your Way</h1>
<p>The first two chapters offer some general concepts and competencies you’ll need as you dive into geospatial analytics. From there, we’ll move into specific tools, using hands-on activities to help you get familiar with them. <a data-type="xref" href="ch03.xhtml#qgis_exploring_pyqgis_and_native_algori">Chapter 3</a> covers QGIS, and <a data-type="xref" href="ch04.xhtml#geospatial_analytics_in_the_cloud_googl">Chapter 4</a> looks at Google Earth Engine and other cloud-based analytics tools. <a data-type="xref" href="ch05.xhtml#openstreetmap_accessing_geospatial_data">Chapter 5</a> introduces you to OpenStreetMap, <a data-type="xref" href="ch06.xhtml#the_arcgis_python_api">Chapter 6</a> shows you around the ArcGIS Python API, and <a data-type="xref" href="ch07.xhtml#geopandas_and_spatial_statistics">Chapter 7</a> explores spatial statistics with the GeoPandas library. <a data-type="xref" href="ch08.xhtml#data_cleaning">Chapter 8</a> pauses for a look at data cleaning: a process for separating the useful data from the noise that often comes with it. <a data-type="xref" href="ch09.xhtml#exploring_the_geospatial_data_abstracti">Chapter 9</a> then introduces a phenomenally useful resource: the Geospatial Data Abstraction Library (GDAL). Finally, in <a data-type="xref" href="ch10.xhtml#using_python_to_measure_climate_data">Chapter 10</a>, three hands-on projects bring all of your learning together to show how useful your geospatial analytics skills can be in researching a pressing global issue: climate change.</p>
<p>At the end of the book, you’ll find a rich trove of links to tools, packages, and data resources as well as citations for the sources used in the text and recommended reading to help you continue your learning journey.</p>

<section data-pdf-bookmark="Acknowledgments" data-type="sect1"><div class="sect1" id="acknowledgements">
<h1>Acknowledgments</h1>
<p>I would like to thank the many geospatial students and professionals alike offering guidance, suggestions, and questions that were the motivation for tackling this topic. The enthusiasm for a book that is both a point of entry and useful guide for the experienced has been a source of great pride.</p>
<p>I am grateful for the tremendous work and support offered by Qiusheng Wu, Assistant Professor in the Department of Geography at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. Dr. Wu’s contributions to the geospatial community are unparalleled, and it was his presentation, <a href="https://oreil.ly/X4Pv6">Google Earth Engine and geemap workshop at GeoPython Conference 2021</a>, that introduced me to the important integration of Google Earth Engine and Python. One year later, I presented at the very same conference.</p>
<p>I also would like to thank Ted Petrou, masterful expert in Python and data exploration at <a href="https://www.dunderdata.com">Dunder Data</a>. Ted offers just-in-time resources and affordable workshops to fill the gap between didactic exposure to Python and applying the skills in your work environment.</p>
<p><a href="https://oreil.ly/3eJ0c">Ujaval Gandhi of SpatialThoughts</a> has been instrumental in introducing geospatial platforms and skills to both enrolled and independent learners. I was on the receiving end of his expertise and generosity on more than one occasion.</p>
<p>A heartfelt thank you and appreciation of camaraderie is extended to my <a href="https://oreil.ly/SeeNU">Geospatial Connections</a> community moderators: Bruce Buxton, Juliana McMillan-Wilhoit, Tim Nolan, and Kendrick Faison. The conversations in this space with our colleagues have been nothing short of amazing and informative.</p>
<p>I thank my husband, Steve, for keeping me supplied with good humor, endless support, big salads, and an inexhaustible supply of Gummy Bears. To my sons, Harrison and Ryland, thanks for being my North Stars, endless sources of wit and charm, and my reason for everything.</p>
