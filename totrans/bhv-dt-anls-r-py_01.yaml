    that new approach, the causal-behavioral framework for data analysis. We’ll look
    at a concrete example showing how even the simplest of data analyses can be derailed
    by the presence of a confounder. Solving that issue is at best complicated and
    at worst impossible with traditional approaches, but the new framework provides
    a straightforward process.'

    the specificities of behavioral data while providing both a gentle introduction
    to behavioral science and a process for ensuring that our data adequately reflects
    the corresponding real-life behaviors.'
