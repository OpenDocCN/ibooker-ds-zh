   <p>Welcome to Chapter 2. This is where the rubber hits the road! By the end of this chapter, you'll be interacting with your first very own Streamlit app!</p>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text  intended-text" id="p6"> 
   <p>This book is not just about teaching you Streamlit though; it's also about making sure you're productive with Streamlit and well-placed to develop apps in the real world. So before we jump into writing code, we'll take some time to set up your development environment. Specifically, we'll talk about three things you'll want to consider while doing so: version control with Git, code editing tools, and virtual environments.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text  intended-text" id="p7"> 
   <p>We'll then examine the workflow you'll follow while coding with Streamlit so you know what to expect as you build apps throughout this book. With that out of the way, I'll walk you step-by-step through actually creating your first app, a password checker.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text  intended-text" id="p8"> 
   <p>Excited yet? Let's dive in!</p>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text" id="p9"> 
   <h2 class=" readable-text-h2">2.1 Getting Streamlit up and running</h2>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text " id="p10"> 
   <p>First things first! Before you can build any apps, you need Streamlit installed and ready to go. This involves two steps:</p>
  </div>
  <ul> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p11">Install the right version of Python (3.8 and above), and <kbd>pip</kbd> (a tool that ships with Python and can install Python packages easily)</li>
   <li class="readable-text" id="p12">Use <kbd>pip</kbd> to install Streamlit (spoiler alert: type <kbd>pip install streamlit</kbd>)</li>
  </ul>
  <div class="readable-text " id="p13"> 
   <p>For a detailed installation guide, see Appendix A of this book.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text" id="p14"> 
   <h2 class=" readable-text-h2">2.2 Setting up your development environment</h2>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text " id="p15"> 
   <p>The tools you use and the way you set up the environment you code your apps in are largely a matter of preference. However, over time, these matters can have an outsized impact on your productivity as a developer, so it's worth your time to consider them.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text  intended-text" id="p16"> 
   <p>In this section I'll briefly discuss a few important aspects of your development environment, namely version control, your editing tool, and virtual environments.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text  intended-text" id="p17"> 
   <p>If you're an experienced Python developer and already have a setup you're comfortable with, go ahead and skip to the section on installing Streamlit.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text" id="p18"> 
   <h3 class=" readable-text-h3">2.2.1 Version control with Git</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text " id="p19"> 
   <p>If you've never written code in a professional setting, there's a chance you may not have used a version control system like Git before, or don't fully understand what it's for.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text  intended-text" id="p20"> 
   <p><em>Version control</em> is a structured way to track, manage, document, and experiment with making changes to your programs. Think of it as a time machine for your code.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text  intended-text" id="p21"> 
   <p>Git is far and away the most popular version control system that exists today, so in this book, we'll use the terms <em>Git</em> and <em>version control</em> interchangeably.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text  intended-text" id="p22"> 
   <p>In the course of working on your apps, there will be occasions when you change your mind and decide to design something differently. In those situations, Git allows you to “go back in time” to how your code <em>used</em> to be and apply the changes from that point.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text  intended-text" id="p23"> 
   <p>You can also experiment with different versions of your code while testing out multiple design options and switch between them easily with Git. Perhaps my favorite aspect of Git is that it lets you document changes to your code, giving you a place to explain your thought process on why you decided to make things a certain way. Trust me—you'll thank yourself six months later while you're reading through your own code and trying to decipher it.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text  intended-text" id="p24"> 
   <p>All of these situations are extremely common when you're working on a large project, or collaborating with others. Even if that <em>doesn't</em> currently apply to you, I highly recommend learning and incorporating Git into your development workflow because the benefits it offers are too numerous to ignore.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text  intended-text" id="p25"> 
   <p>If I've sold you on the benefits of version control, check out the section called “A whirlwind intro to Git” in Chapter 5 for a quick look at the basics. It's designed to be a standalone section, so if you like, you can go to it right now and come back when you're done. If you're (understandably) impatient to get started with Streamlit, read on.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text" id="p26"> 
   <h3 class=" readable-text-h3">2.2.2 Code editors</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text " id="p27"> 
   <p>Streamlit apps, like all Python scripts, are just text files, so all you <em>really </em>need to write code is a simple text editor (like Notepad in Windows).</p>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text  intended-text" id="p28"> 
   <p>However, using an advanced code editor or an <em>Integrated Development Environment</em> (IDE) makes you so much more productive—giving you features like syntax highlighting, easy debugging tools, and code navigation—that it's hard not to recommend using one.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text  intended-text" id="p29"> 
   <p>There are many, many tools that will fit the bill, but I'd like to mention two of the most popular ones here.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text sub-sub-section-heading" id="p30"> 
   <h4 class=" readable-text-h4">PyCharm</h4>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text " id="p31"> 
   <p>PyCharm is a versatile IDE tailor-made for Python, developed by the company JetBrains. It offers comprehensive support for Python out of the box, such as code completion, error detection, quick-fix suggestions and more.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text  intended-text" id="p32"> 
   <p>PyCharm is an excellent choice if you're seeking advanced functionality straight from installation without having to tinker around too much. The Pro edition costs money, but PyCharm has a Community Edition you can get for free at <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download">https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download</a> (make sure you scroll down to where it says “Community Edition”).</p>
  </div>
  <div class="browsable-container figure-container" id="p33">  
   <img src="../Images/02__image001.png" alt="image"/> 
   <h5 class=" figure-container-h5">Figure 2.1 The project editor window in PyCharm Community Edition</h5>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text sub-sub-section-heading" id="p34"> 
   <h4 class=" readable-text-h4">Visual Studio Code</h4>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text " id="p35"> 
   <p>Visual Studio Code (VS Code for short) is an immensely popular code editor maintained by Microsoft. It supports a multitude of languages.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text  intended-text" id="p36"> 
   <p>VS Code offers some essential functionality such as syntax highlighting right away, but its true strength lies in its ecosystem of plugins that can extend its capabilities. Indeed, with the right set of plugins, you can make VS Code do essentially everything PyCharm Professional (the paid version) can do.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text  intended-text" id="p37"> 
   <p>Since VS Code is completely free, it's an attractive proposition for learners who don't mind spending some time to set everything up.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text  intended-text" id="p38"> 
   <p>Note: Since both of these (and many others, such as Sublime Text and Notepad++) are viable code editing tools, I won't assume that you're using any particular one. As long as you have a terminal you can type commands into and a program that can edit text files, you're good to go as far as this book is concerned.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text" id="p39"> 
   <h3 class=" readable-text-h3">2.2.3 Virtual environments</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text " id="p40"> 
   <p>Most useful real-world Python projects you work on will require you to rely on a variety of libraries. These libraries change all the time, releasing new versions that add and remove features or modify existing ones.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text  intended-text" id="p41"> 
   <p>As you gain experience and create more complex applications, you'll often find that updating a library for one project causes another to break or leads to unpredictable bugs and conflicts.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text  intended-text" id="p42"> 
   <p>Virtual environments are a way out of this dilemma. A virtual environment consists of an isolated instance of Python and a set of libraries and dependencies. Each project you start should live in its own virtual environment. That way, you can modify the dependencies of any project without affecting any others.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text  intended-text" id="p43"> 
   <p>Even if you're just starting out and haven't run into dependency management problems, it's a great idea to get familiar with virtual environments. There are several virtual environment-related libraries and tools available with varying levels of sophistication: you may come across <kbd>venv</kbd>, <kbd>pipenv</kbd>, <kbd>pyenv</kbd>, <kbd>poetry</kbd> and others.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text  intended-text" id="p44"> 
   <p>We'll discuss virtual environments in more detail in Chapter 13 while exploring how to distribute your code.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text" id="p45"> 
   <h2 class=" readable-text-h2">2.3 Running Streamlit for the first time</h2>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text " id="p46"> 
   <p>This is where the fun begins! In this section, we'll run a Streamlit app for the first time, and get a first-hand look at the kind of things you can devise with Streamlit.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text  intended-text" id="p47"> 
   <p>If you haven't already done so, go to Appendix A and make sure you have Streamlit installed.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text  intended-text" id="p48"> 
   <p>If you have, open up a terminal window and let's get started!</p>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text  intended-text" id="p49"> 
   <p>The app we'll be running is the <em>hello </em>app that comes pre-built with Streamlit. To see it in action, type <kbd>streamlit hello</kbd> in your terminal.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text  intended-text" id="p50"> 
   <p>This should display some output on the terminal that you can ignore for now, and after a few seconds, opens your web browser to display the actual app.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text  intended-text" id="p51"> 
   <p>The <em>hello</em> app shows off Streamlit's capabilities by demoing a variety of features: animation, graph plotting, maps, and tables.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text  intended-text" id="p52"> 
   <p>Figure 2.2 shows one such demo: an animation built from a mathematical visualization. You can navigate to other demos using the sidebar on the left.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="browsable-container figure-container" id="p53">  
   <img src="../Images/02__image002.png" alt="image"/> 
   <h5 class=" figure-container-h5">Figure 2.2 Animation Demo from streamlit hello</h5>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text " id="p54"> 
   <p>Figure 2.3 shows a more practical demo related to Pandas dataframes. We'll become intimately familiar with these later in the book.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="browsable-container figure-container" id="p55">  
   <img src="../Images/02__image003.png" alt="image"/> 
   <h5 class=" figure-container-h5">Figure 2.3 DataFrame Demo from streamlit hello</h5>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text " id="p56"> 
   <p>I hope looking at these examples inspires you!</p>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text  intended-text" id="p57"> 
   <p>The sidebar also has a “Show code” checkbox which, as you might imagine, displays the source code for each app below the app itself. In each instance, you'll find that the code isn't terribly verbose.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text  intended-text" id="p58"> 
   <p>Obviously, you don't have to understand how all of this is done right now, but hopefully you'll gain some appreciation for what Streamlit makes possible.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text" id="p59"> 
   <h2 class=" readable-text-h2">2.4 The Streamlit development workflow</h2>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text " id="p60"> 
   <p>Writing Streamlit apps - or any kind of programming, really - is an iterative process where you write some code, test if it works, and repeat. If you've never written graphical applications before, you may be curious about what this process looks like.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text  intended-text" id="p61"> 
   <p>Figure 2.4 describes the development workflow you'll soon get used to.</p>

   <h5 class=" figure-container-h5">Figure 2.4 The Streamlit development workflow</h5>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text " id="p63"> 
   <p>Let's walk through the steps:</p>
  </div>
  <ol class=" ol-with-buletless-items"> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p64"><strong>Write your Python code: </strong>Create a first draft of your app in a Python file in your code editor. This can be as basic or as fleshed-out as you like. Some people like to run the app right from the outset as they begin to shape it and visualize every change as they go, so their first draft may just be an empty app with a title.</li>
   <li class="readable-text buletless-item" style="list-style-type: none;" id="p65">I myself find this distracting since it's tempting to spend time fine-tuning the appearance of the app if I see it early on. Instead, I prefer to code up a roughly complete version of the app before I run it for the first time. This is entirely a matter of preference though.</li>
   <li class="readable-text" id="p66"><strong>Save your file: </strong>This should be self-explanatory. Save your Python file as you would normally, with a <kbd>.py</kbd> extension.</li>
   <li class="readable-text" id="p67"><strong>Run your app using </strong><kbd class="bold">streamlit run &lt;filename&gt;</kbd><strong>: </strong>Run this in your terminal and replace <kbd>&lt;filename&gt;</kbd> with the path to your file.</li>
   <li class="readable-text buletless-item" style="list-style-type: none;" id="p68">This opens a browser window with your app, as you saw when you ran the <em>hello</em> app.</li>
   <li class="readable-text" id="p69"><strong>Test your app in the browser:</strong> Interact with your app. Play around with it by entering values, clicking buttons etc., and seeing if the output matches what you'd expect.</li>
   <li class="readable-text" id="p70"><strong>Make code changes as needed: </strong>Based on your testing, go back to your Python code and edit it.</li>
   <li class="readable-text" id="p71"><strong>Save your changes: </strong>Again, self-explanatory.</li>
   <li class="readable-text" id="p72">Switch back to your browser window: Remember, you don't need to re-run <kbd>streamlit run &lt;filename&gt;</kbd> to see your changes in the app.</li>
   <li class="readable-text" id="p73"><strong>You have two options here:</strong> If you want Streamlit to re-run your app with your changes automatically, you can click “Always rerun” in your app. Otherwise, you can still click “Rerun” each time.</li>
   <li class="readable-text" id="p74">Repeat steps 4-7</li>
  </ol>
  <div class="readable-text " id="p75"> 
   <p>You'll be going through these steps a <em>lot</em> throughout this book, and it'll soon become second nature. But enough theory, let's put this in action!</p>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text" id="p76"> 
   <h2 class=" readable-text-h2">2.5 Building your first app</h2>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text " id="p77"> 
   <p>In this section, we'll craft our very first app! To do this, I'll first introduce the concept behind the app and outline the flow of logic.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text  intended-text" id="p78"> 
   <p>I'll then walk you through the code for the complete app, explaining each part of it step-by-step. Finally, we'll run the app and make changes to it.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text  intended-text" id="p79"> 
   <p>A word of advice before we dive in: Your learning experience will be richer if you take an active role in it, tinkering and experimenting as you go. Be curious and don't be afraid to make changes outside of those suggested in the text! You'll often find that the parts of the material that stick in your mind the best are the ones where you took the initiative to explore and understand on your own.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text  intended-text" id="p80"> 
   <p>With that said, it's time to get our hands dirty!</p>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text" id="p81"> 
   <h3 class=" readable-text-h3">2.5.1 A password checker</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text " id="p82"> 
   <p>You've probably visited one of those websites that have a huge list of conditions that your password needs to fulfill, like containing at least one lowercase letter, one special character, an even number of underscores, the names of up to two dwarves from Snow White, and so forth.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text  intended-text" id="p83"> 
   <p>The app we'll create is one that lets the user enter a password they're considering, and shows them which conditions pass and which ones fail.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text" id="p84"> 
   <h3 class=" readable-text-h3">2.5.2 Logic flow</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text " id="p85"> 
   <p>Figure 2.5 lays out the flow of our app's logic.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text  intended-text" id="p86"> 
   <p>It begins when the user enters a password in an input text box and initiates the checking process by clicking a button.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text  intended-text" id="p87"> 
   <p>Internally, the app maintains a list of conditions (technically a dictionary, in the code) to be checked in its memory. We loop through this list, categorizing each condition as either “PASS” or “FAIL” depending on whether the entered password meets it, and generate a fresh list (or dictionary) of results.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text  intended-text" id="p88"> 
   <p>Following this, we iterate through the results, presenting the outcomes on the screen. Each condition is represented by a box, displayed in green if it passed or red if it failed.</p>

   <p>In this case, the functions are <em>lambdas</em> or anonymous in-line functions. A lambda is a cool way to define a short one-line function in Python without having to go to the trouble of giving it a name.

   <p>It returns a new Python dictionary where the keys are the conditions and the values are the results of running the lambda function corresponding to each condition that we defined above.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text  intended-text" id="p106"> 
   <p>The syntax we've used here is called a <em>dictionary comprehension</em> in Python, and it's short-hand to create a new dictionary from some input.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text  intended-text" id="p107"> 
   <p>Next is our first actual Streamlit element. It's a simple one called <kbd>title</kbd>:</p>
  </div>
  <div class="browsable-container listing-container" id="p108"> 
   <div class="code-area-container"> 
    <pre class="code-area">st.title("Password Checker")</pre>
   </div>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text " id="p109"> 
   <p>It does what you'd expect it to, which is to display the passed text as a title, in nice large type.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text  intended-text" id="p110"> 
   <p>We use the following line to show a password input box to the user:</p>
  </div>
  <div class="browsable-container listing-container" id="p111"> 
   <div class="code-area-container"> 
    <pre class="code-area">password_input = st.text_input("Enter your password", type="password")
 </pre>
   </div>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text " id="p112"> 
   <p>Streamlit's implementation of this also offers a toggle to show/hide the entered text. When the user enters some text, it's saved in the <kbd>password_input</kbd> variable.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text  intended-text" id="p113"> 
   <p><kbd>st.button</kbd> is one of the simplest Streamlit elements and one you'll be working with frequently. Unsurprisingly, here it displays a button with the text “Check password:”</p>
  </div>
  <div class="browsable-container listing-container" id="p114"> 
   <div class="code-area-container"> 
    <pre class="code-area">if st.button("Check password"):</pre>
   </div>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text " id="p115"> 
   <p>Notice that this goes in an <kbd>if</kbd> clause. Whatever code is nested within the <kbd>if </kbd>(see below) is evaluated when the button is clicked. There are some interesting nuances to this that we'll dive into in Chapter 4.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text  intended-text" id="p116"> 
   <p>Once the button is clicked, our app checks if <kbd>password_input</kbd> has a non-empty value, i.e., if the user has actually entered a password. If they have, it calls <kbd>get_password_properties</kbd> on it to evaluate the conditions we defined:</p>
  </div>
  <div class="browsable-container listing-container" id="p117"> 
   <div class="code-area-container"> 
    <pre class="code-area">if password_input:
        properties = get_password_properties(password_input)
 
        # Loop through password conditions and show the status for each
        for condition, passes in properties.items():
            if passes:
                st.success(f'✔ Pass: {condition}')
            else:
                st.error(f'✖ Fail: {condition}')
 </pre>
   </div>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text " id="p118"> 
   <p>It then loops through the returned dictionary, where each key is a condition and the corresponding value is a boolean indicating if the condition passed.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text  intended-text" id="p119"> 
   <p>If the condition passes, we use another Streamlit element, <kbd>st.success</kbd> to indicate this, and if it didn't, we use <kbd>st.error</kbd> to show that it failed.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text  intended-text" id="p120"> 
   <p><kbd>st.success</kbd> and <kbd>st.error</kbd> are both just containers for text with some semantic styles applied (i.e., mostly a green box for <kbd>st.success</kbd> and a red one for <kbd>st.error</kbd>)</p>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text  intended-text" id="p121"> 
   <p>This <kbd>else</kbd> corresponds to the if <kbd>password_input</kbd> from earlier:</p>
