    in revenue among the firms but will not bias the result if the assumption above

    and the result didn’t change much. The intuition is that Difference-in-Differences

    There are different Fixed Effects. Let’s add Industry Fixed Effects to the Difference-in-Differences
    (DID) specification to discard the possibility that the results might be driven
    by Industry specific shocks.

- en: Why not add Firm and Industry Fixed Effects in the same time? It is possible
    and recommendable, but the computer will not return any result given the problem
    of multicollinearity. We have only two observations (2 years) per firm. If we
    add one dummy variable for each firm, it is like to run a regression with more
    variables than observations.

- en: In his paper Ziebarth (2013) presents results using Firm and Industry Fixed
    Effects, how is it possible? Ziebarth (2013) used Stata software. Stata automatically
    drops some variables in the case of multicollinearity problem and outputs a result.
    Although this practice is well-diffused in Top Journals of Economics, it is not
    the “true” Fixed Effects.

    ignored. This assumption is called Random Effects (RE). In this case, \(\alpha_i\)
    will be inside the error term \(v_{it}\) and potentially biased the results.
