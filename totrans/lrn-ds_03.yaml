    data collection process can significantly impact the validity and accuracy of
    the data, the strength of the conclusions we draw from an analysis, and the decisions
    we make. In this chapter, we describe a general approach for understanding data
    collection and evaluating the usefulness of the data in addressing the question
    of interest. Ideally, we aim for data to be representative of the phenomenon that
    we are studying, whether that phenomenon is a population characteristic, a physical
    model, or some type of social behavior. Typically, our data do not contain complete
    information (the scope is restricted in some way), yet we want to use the data
    to accurately describe a population, estimate a scientific quantity, infer the
    form of a relationship between features, or predict future outcomes. In all of
    these situations, if our data are not representative of the object of our study,
    then our conclusions can be limited, possibly misleading, or even wrong.

    the power of big data and what can go wrong. We then provide a framework that
    can help you connect the goal of your study (your question) with the data collection
    process. We refer to this as the *data scope*,^([1](ch02.html#id636)) and we provide
    terminology to help describe data scope, along with examples from surveys, government
    data, scientific instruments, and online resources. Later in this chapter, we
    consider what it means for data to be accurate. There, we introduce different
    forms of bias and variation, and describe situations where they can arise. Throughout,
    the examples cover the spectrum of the sorts of data that you may be using as
    a data scientist; these examples are from science, politics, public health, and
    online communities.

    data much like how traditional beat reporters hunt for news stories. The lifecycle

    an interesting story, rather than beginning with a research question and figuring
    out how to collect new or use existing data to address the question.

    Researchers can link data collected from scientific studies with, say, medical
    data that have been collected for health-care purposes; these administrative data
    have been collected for reasons that don’t directly stem from the question of
    interest, but they can be useful in other settings. Such linkages can help data
    scientists expand the possibilities of their analyses and cross-check the quality
    of their data. In addition, found data can include digital traces, such as your
    web-browsing activity, your posts on social media, and your online network of
    friends and acquaintances, and they can be quite complex.

    it can be tempting to treat them as more definitive than data collected from traditional,
    smaller research studies. We might even consider these large datasets to be a
    replacement for scientific studies and essentially a census. This overreach is
    referred to as [“big data hubris”](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1248506). Data
    with a large scope does not mean that we can ignore foundational issues of how
    representative the data are, nor can we ignore issues with measurement, dependency,
    and reliability. (And it can be easy to discover meaningless or nonsensical relationships
    just by coincidence.) One well-known example is the Google Flu Trends tracking

    the target population. Ideally, the access frame and population are perfectly
    aligned, meaning they consist of the exact same elements. However, the units in
    an access frame may be only a subset of the target population; additionally, the
    frame may include units that don’t belong to the population. For example, to find
    out how a voter intends to vote in an election, you might call people by phone.
    Someone you call may not be a voter, so they are in your frame but not in the
    population. On the other hand, a voter who never answers a call from an unknown
    number can’t be reached, so they are in the population but not in your frame.

    a small sample can be more effective than a large sample or an attempt at a census

    Additionally, data collected for the purpose of studying changes over time, like
    with the monthly measurements of carbon dioxide (CO[2]) in the atmosphere (see
    [Chapter 9](ch09.html#ch-wrangling)) and the weekly reporting of Google searches
    for predicting flu trends, have a *temporal* structure that we need to be mindful
    of as we examine the data. At other times, there might be *spatial* patterns in
    the data. For example, the environmental health data, described later in this

    sample chooses the units that are most easily available. Problems can arise when
    those who are easy to reach differ in important ways from those who are harder

    For example, low humidity can systematically give us incorrectly high measurements
    of air pollution. In addition, measurement devices can become unstable and drift
    over time and so produce systematic errors. In surveys, measurement bias can arise
    when questions are confusingly worded or leading, or when respondents may not
    be comfortable answering honestly.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Each of these types of bias can lead to situations where the data are not centered
    on the unknown targeted value. Often, we cannot assess the potential magnitude
    of the bias, since little to no information is available on those who are outside
    the access frame, less likely to be selected for the sample, or disinclined to
    respond. Protocols are key to reducing these sources of bias. Chance mechanisms
    to select a sample from the frame or to assign units to experimental conditions
    can eliminate selection bias. A nonresponse follow-up protocol to encourage participation
    can reduce nonresponse bias. A pilot survey can improve question wording and so
    reduce measurement bias. Procedures to calibrate instruments and protocols to
    take measurements in, say, random order can reduce measurement bias.

    highly precise (low variance) and has a small bias, then that instrument might
    be preferable to another with higher variance and no bias. As an example, biased
    studies are potentially useful to pilot a survey instrument or to capture useful
    information for the design of a larger study. Many times we can at best recruit
    volunteers for a study. Given this limitation, it can still be useful to enroll
    these volunteers in the study and use random assignment to split them into treatment
    groups. That’s the idea behind randomized controlled experiments.

    of drawing marbles from the urn to reason about sampling schemes, randomized controlled
    experiments, and measurement error. For each of these types of variation, the
    urn model helps us estimate the size of the variation using either probability
    or simulation (see [Chapter 3](ch03.html#ch-theory-datadesign)). The example of

    mechanism. If we were to repeat the first sampling activity again, returning all
    1,440 marbles to the original urn, then we would most likely get a different sample.
    This variation is the source of *sampling variation*. Likewise, if we were to
    repeat the random assignment process again (keeping the sample of 200 unchanged),
    then we would get a different treatment group. *Assignment variation* arises from
    this second chance process.

    variation. In both cases, the researcher imposed a chance mechanism on the data

    error of the CO[2] monitor at Mauna Loa in this way.

    we can give concrete values for the variation in our data. However, it’s vital
