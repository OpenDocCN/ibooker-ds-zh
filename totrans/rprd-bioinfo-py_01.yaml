- en: The chapters in this part explore the elements of Python’s syntax and tooling
    that will enable you to write well-structured, documented, tested, and reproducible
    programs. I’ll show you how to solve 14 challenges from [Rosalind.info](http://rosalind.info).
    These problems are short and focused and allow for many different solutions that
    will help you explore Python. I’ll also teach you how to write a program, step-by-step,
    using tests to guide you and to let you know when you’re done. I encourage you
    to read the Rosalind page for each problem, as I do not have space to recapitulate
    all the background and information there.
