- en: 'This is a book about doing data science with Python, which immediately begs
    the question: what is *data science*? It’s a surprisingly hard definition to nail
    down, especially given how ubiquitous the term has become. Vocal critics have
    variously dismissed it as a superfluous label (after all, what science doesn’t
    involve data?) or a simple buzzword that only exists to salt resumes and catch
    the eye of overzealous tech recruiters.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'In my mind, these critiques miss something important. Data science, despite
    its hype-laden veneer, is perhaps the best label we have for the cross-disciplinary
    set of skills that are becoming increasingly important in many applications across
    industry and academia. This *cross-disciplinary* piece is key: in my mind, the
    best existing definition of data science is illustrated by Drew Conway’s Data
    Science Venn Diagram, first published on his blog in September 2010 ([Figure P-1](#fig_images_in_data_science_vd)).'

- en: 'While some of the intersection labels are a bit tongue-in-cheek, this diagram
    captures the essence of what I think people mean when they say “data science”:
    it is fundamentally an interdisciplinary subject. Data science comprises three
    distinct and overlapping areas: the skills of a *statistician* who knows how to
    model and summarize datasets (which are growing ever larger); the skills of a
    *computer scientist* who can design and use algorithms to efficiently store, process,
    and visualize this data; and the *domain expertise*—what we might think of as
    “classical” training in a subject—necessary both to formulate the right questions
    and to put their answers in context.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With this in mind, I would encourage you to think of data science not as a new
    domain of knowledge to learn, but a new set of skills that you can apply within
    your current area of expertise. Whether you are reporting election results, forecasting
    stock returns, optimizing online ad clicks, identifying microorganisms in microscope
    photos, seeking new classes of astronomical objects, or working with data in any
    other field, the goal of this book is to give you the ability to ask and answer
    new questions about your chosen subject area.

- en: 'In my teaching both at the University of Washington and at various tech-focused
    conferences and meetups, one of the most common questions I have heard is this:
    “How should I learn Python?” The people asking are generally technically minded
    students, developers, or researchers, often with an already strong background
    in writing code and using computational and numerical tools. Most of these folks
    don’t want to learn Python per se, but want to learn the language with the aim
    of using it as a tool for data-intensive and computational science. While a large
    patchwork of videos, blog posts, and tutorials for this audience is available
    online, I’ve long been frustrated by the lack of a single good answer to this
    question; that is what inspired this book.'

    I assume the reader has familiarity with the Python language, including defining
    functions, assigning variables, calling methods of objects, controlling the flow
    of a program, and other basic tasks. Instead, it is meant to help Python users
    learn to use Python’s data science stack—libraries such as those mentioned in
    the following section, and related tools—to effectively store, manipulate, and
    gain insight from data.

- en: 'Python has emerged over the past couple of decades as a first-class tool for
    scientific computing tasks, including the analysis and visualization of large
    datasets. This may have come as a surprise to early proponents of the Python language:
    the language itself was not specifically designed with data analysis or scientific
    computing in mind. The usefulness of Python for data science stems primarily from
    the large and active ecosystem of third-party packages: *NumPy* for manipulation
    of homogeneous array-based data, *Pandas* for manipulation of heterogeneous and
    labeled data, *SciPy* for common scientific computing tasks, *Matplotlib* for
    publication-quality visualizations, *IPython* for interactive execution and sharing
    of code, *Scikit-Learn* for machine learning, and many more tools that will be
    mentioned in the following pages.'

    aimed at data scientists who are already familiar with one or more other programming

    growing every day. With this in mind, I make every attempt throughout this book
    to provide references to other interesting efforts, projects, and packages that
    are pushing the boundaries of what can be done in Python. Nevertheless, the packages
    I concentrate on are currently fundamental to much of the work being done in the
    Python data science space, and I expect they will remain important even as the
    ecosystem continues growing around them.
