<h1><span class="label">Part IV. </span>Visualization with Matplotlib</h1>
<p><a data-primary="Matplotlib" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45858763416720"/><a data-primary="plotting" data-secondary="Matplotlib" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45858763416016"/>We’ll now take an in-depth look at the Matplotlib package
for visualization in Python. Matplotlib is a multiplatform data
visualization library built on NumPy arrays and designed to work with
the broader SciPy stack. <a data-primary="Hunter, John" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45858763414944"/>It was conceived by John Hunter in 2002,
originally as a patch to IPython for enabling interactive MATLAB-style
plotting via <code>gnuplot</code> from the IPython command line.
<a data-primary="Perez, Fernando" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45858763413712"/>IPython’s creator, Fernando Perez, was at the time
scrambling to finish his PhD, and let John know he wouldn’t have time to
review the patch for several months. John took this as a cue to set out
on his own, and the Matplotlib package was born, with version 0.1
released in 2003. It received an early boost when it was adopted as the
plotting package of choice of the Space Telescope Science Institute (the
folks behind the Hubble Telescope), which financially supported
Matplotlib’s development and greatly expanded its capabilities.</p>
<p>One of Matplotlib’s most important features is its ability to play well
with many operating systems and graphics backends. Matplotlib supports
dozens of backends and output types, which means you can count on it to
work regardless of which operating system you are using or which output
format you desire. This cross-platform, everything-to-everyone approach
has been one of the great strengths of Matplotlib. It has led to a large
user base, which in turn has led to an active developer base and
Matplotlib’s powerful tools and ubiquity within the scientific Python
world.</p>
<p>In recent years, however, the interface and style of Matplotlib have
begun to show their age. Newer tools like <code>ggplot</code> and <code>ggvis</code> in the R
language, along with web visualization toolkits based on D3js and HTML5
canvas, often make Matplotlib feel clunky and old-fashioned. Still,
I’m of the opinion that we cannot ignore
Matplotlib’s strength as a well-tested, cross-platform
graphics engine. Recent Matplotlib versions make it relatively easy to
set new global plotting styles (see
<a data-type="xref" href="ch34.xhtml#section-0411-settings-and-stylesheets">Chapter 34</a>), and people have been developing new
packages that build on its powerful internals to drive Matplotlib via
cleaner, more modern APIs—for example, Seaborn (discussed in
<a data-type="xref" href="ch36.xhtml#section-0414-visualization-with-seaborn">Chapter 36</a>), <a href="http://yhat.github.io/ggpy"><code>ggpy</code></a>,
<a href="http://holoviews.org">HoloViews</a>, and even Pandas itself can be used as
wrappers around Matplotlib’s API. Even with wrappers like
these, it is still often useful to dive into Matplotlib’s
syntax to adjust the final plot output. For this reason, I believe that
Matplotlib itself will remain a vital piece of the data visualization
stack, even if new tools mean the community gradually moves away from
using the Matplotlib API directly.</p>
