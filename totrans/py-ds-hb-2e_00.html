<h1>What Is Data Science?</h1>
<p>This is a book about doing data science with Python, which immediately
begs the question: what is <em>data science</em>? It’s a
surprisingly hard definition to nail down, especially given how
ubiquitous the term has become. Vocal critics have variously dismissed
it as a superfluous label (after all, what science doesn’t
involve data?) or a simple buzzword that only exists to salt resumes and
catch the eye of overzealous tech recruiters.</p>
<p>In my mind, these critiques miss something important. Data science,
despite its hype-laden veneer, is perhaps the best label we have for the
cross-disciplinary set of skills that are becoming increasingly
important in many applications across industry and academia. <a data-primary="Conway, Drew" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45858814482128"/><a data-primary="data science, defining" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45858814087408"/>This
<em>cross-disciplinary</em> piece is key: in my mind, the best existing
definition of data science is illustrated by Drew Conway’s
Data Science Venn Diagram, first published on his blog in September 2010
(<a data-type="xref" href="#fig_images_in_data_science_vd">Figure P-1</a>).</p>
<p>While some of the intersection labels are a bit tongue-in-cheek, this
diagram captures the essence of what I think people mean when they say
“data science”: it is fundamentally an interdisciplinary subject. Data
science comprises three distinct and overlapping areas: the skills of a
<em>statistician</em> who knows how to model and summarize datasets (which are
growing ever larger); the skills of a <em>computer scientist</em> who can
design and use algorithms to efficiently store, process, and visualize
this data; and the <em>domain expertise</em>—what we might think of as
“classical” training in a subject—necessary both to formulate the
right questions and to put their answers in context.</p>
<p>With this in mind, I would encourage you to think of data science not as
a new domain of knowledge to learn, but a new set of skills that you can
apply within your current area of expertise. Whether you are reporting
election results, forecasting stock returns, optimizing online ad
clicks, identifying microorganisms in microscope photos, seeking new
classes of astronomical objects, or working with data in any other
field, the goal of this book is to give you the ability to ask and
answer new questions about your chosen subject area.</p>

<section data-pdf-bookmark="Who Is This Book For?" data-type="sect1"><div class="sect1" id="ch_0000-preface_who-is-this-book-for">
<h1>Who Is This Book For?</h1>
<p>In my teaching both at the University of Washington and at various
tech-focused conferences and meetups, one of the most common questions I
have heard is this: “How should I learn Python?” The people asking are
generally technically minded students, developers, or researchers, often
with an already strong background in writing code and using
computational and numerical tools. Most of these folks don’t
want to learn Python per se, but want to learn the language with the
aim of using it as a tool for data-intensive and computational science.
While a large patchwork of videos, blog posts, and tutorials for this
audience is available online, I’ve long been frustrated by
the lack of a single good answer to this question; that is what inspired
this book.</p>
<p>The book is not meant to be an introduction to Python or to programming
in general; I assume the reader has familiarity with the Python
language, including defining functions, assigning variables, calling
methods of objects, controlling the flow of a program, and other basic
tasks. Instead, it is meant to help Python users learn to use
Python’s data science stack—libraries such as those
mentioned in the following section, and related tools—to effectively
store, manipulate, and gain insight from data.</p>
</div></section>
<section data-pdf-bookmark="Why Python?" data-type="sect1"><div class="sect1" id="ch_0000-preface_why-python">
<h1>Why Python?</h1>
<p><a data-primary="Python (generally)" data-secondary="reasons for using" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45858813700336"/>Python has emerged over the past couple of decades as a first-class tool
for scientific computing tasks, including the analysis and visualization
of large datasets. This may have come as a surprise to early proponents
of the Python language: the language itself was not specifically
designed with data analysis or scientific computing in mind. The
usefulness of Python for data science stems primarily from the large and
active ecosystem of third-party packages: <em>NumPy</em> for manipulation of
homogeneous array-based data, <em>Pandas</em> for manipulation of heterogeneous
and labeled data, <em>SciPy</em> for common scientific computing tasks,
<em>Matplotlib</em> for publication-quality visualizations, <em>IPython</em> for
interactive execution and sharing of code, <em>Scikit-Learn</em> for machine
learning, and many more tools that will be mentioned in the following
pages.</p>
<p>If you are looking for a guide to the Python language itself, I would
suggest the sister project to this book,
<a href="https://oreil.ly/jFtWj"><em>A Whirlwind Tour of Python</em></a>.
This short report provides a tour of the essential features of the
Python language, aimed at data scientists who are already familiar with
one or more other programming languages.</p>

<section data-pdf-bookmark="Outline of the Book" data-type="sect1"><div class="sect1" id="ch_0000-preface_outline-of-the-book">
<h1>Outline of the Book</h1>
<p>Each numbered part of this book focuses on a particular package or tool
that contributes a fundamental piece of the Python data science story,
and is broken into short self-contained chapters that each discuss a
single concept:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="chap-num-title" href="part01.xhtml#section-0100-ipython-beyond-normal-python">Part I, “Jupyter: Beyond Normal Python”</a> introduces IPython and
Jupyter. These packages provide the computational environment in which
many Python-using data scientists work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="chap-num-title" href="part02.xhtml#section-0200-introduction-to-numpy">Part II, “Introduction to NumPy”</a> focuses on the NumPy library, which
provides the <code>ndarray</code> for efficient storage and manipulation of dense
data arrays in Python.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="chap-num-title" href="part03.xhtml#section-0300-introduction-to-pandas">Part III, “Data Manipulation with Pandas”</a> introduces the Pandas
library, which provides the <code>DataFrame</code> for efficient storage and
manipulation of labeled/columnar data in Python.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="chap-num-title" href="part04.xhtml#section-0400-introduction-to-matplotlib">Part IV, “Visualization with Matplotlib”</a> concentrates on Matplotlib,
a library that provides capabilities for a flexible range of data
visualizations in Python.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="chap-num-title" href="part05.xhtml#section-0500-machine-learning">Part V, “Machine Learning”</a> focuses on the Scikit-Learn library, which
provides efficient and clean Python implementations of the most
important and established machine learning algorithms.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The PyData world is certainly much larger than these six packages, and
it’s growing every day. With this in mind, I make every attempt throughout
this book to provide references to other interesting efforts, projects,
and packages that are pushing the boundaries of what can be done in
Python. Nevertheless, the packages I concentrate on are currently
fundamental to much of the work being done in the Python data science
space, and I expect they will remain important even as the ecosystem
continues growing around them.</p>

<section data-pdf-bookmark="Installation Considerations" data-type="sect1"><div class="sect1" id="ch_0000-preface_installation-considerations">
<h1>Installation Considerations</h1>
<p><a data-primary="installation, Python" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45858828732144"/><a data-primary="Python (generally)" data-secondary="installation considerations" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45858826949984"/>Installing Python and the suite of libraries that enable scientific
computing is straightforward. This section will outline some of the
things to keep in mind when setting up your computer.</p>
<p><a data-primary="Anaconda" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45858829691056"/>Though there are various ways to install Python, the one I would suggest
for use in data science is the Anaconda distribution, which works
similarly whether you use Windows, Linux, or macOS. The Anaconda
distribution comes in two flavors:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a data-primary="Miniconda" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45858824903216"/><a href="https://oreil.ly/dH7wJ">Miniconda</a> gives you the Python
interpreter itself, along with a command-line tool called <em>conda</em> which
operates as a cross-platform package manager geared toward Python
packages, similar in spirit to the apt or yum tools that Linux users
might be familiar with.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://oreil.ly/ndxjm">Anaconda</a> includes both Python and
conda, and additionally bundles a suite of other preinstalled packages
geared toward scientific computing. Because of the size of this bundle,
expect the installation to consume several gigabytes of disk space.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Any of the packages included with Anaconda can also be installed
manually on top of Miniconda; for this reason I suggest starting with
Miniconda.</p>
<p>To get started, download and install the Miniconda package—make sure to
choose a version with Python 3—and then install the core packages used
in this book:</p>
<pre data-type="programlisting">
[~]$ <strong>conda install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn jupyter</strong>
</pre>
<p>Throughout the text, we will also make use of other more specialized
tools in Python’s scientific ecosystem; installation is
usually as easy as typing <strong><code>conda install <em>packagename</em></code></strong>. If you ever
come across packages that are not available in the default conda
channel, be sure to check out <a href="https://oreil.ly/CCvwQ"><em>conda-forge</em></a>, a
broad, community-driven repository of conda packages.</p>
<p>For more information on conda, including information about creating and
using conda environments (which I would <em>highly</em> recommend), refer to
<a href="https://oreil.ly/MkqPw">conda’s online 
<span class="keep-together">documentation</span></a>.</p>
