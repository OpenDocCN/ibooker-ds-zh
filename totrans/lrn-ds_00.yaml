    is valuable for all kinds of decision making across business, medicine, policy,
    and more. This book, *Learning Data Science*, aims to prepare readers to do data
    science. To achieve this, we’ve designed this book with the following special
    features:'

- en: Technologies come and go. While we work with specific technologies in this book,
    our goal is to equip readers with the fundamental building blocks of data science.
    We do this by revealing how to think about data science problems and challenges,
    and by covering the fundamentals behind the individual technologies. Our aim is
    to serve readers even as technologies change.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Instead of just focusing on a single topic, like how to work with data tables
    or how to apply machine learning techniques, we cover the entire data science
    lifecycle—the process of asking a question, obtaining data, understanding the
    data, and understanding the world. Working through the entire lifecycle can often
    be the hardest part of being a data scientist.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To be prepared for working on real problems, we consider it essential to learn
    from examples that use real data, with their warts and all. We chose the datasets
    presented in this book by carefully picking from actual data analyses that have
    made an impact, rather than using overly refined or synthetic data.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    analyses from other data scientists. These case studies show readers how to navigate
    the data science lifecycle in real settings.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: On the job, data scientists need to foresee how the decisions they make when
    writing code and how the size of a dataset might affect statistical analysis.
    To prepare readers for their future work, *Learning Data Science* integrates computational
    and statistical thinking. We also motivate statistical concepts through simulation
    studies rather than mathematical proofs.

    data structures like lists, dictionaries, and sets; import and use functions and
    classes from other packages; and write functions from scratch. We also use the
    `numpy` Python package without introduction but don’t expect readers to have much
    prior experience using it.

- en: This book has come about from our joint experience designing and teaching “Principles
    and Techniques of Data Science,” an undergraduate course at the University of
    California, Berkeley. We first taught “Data 100” in spring 2017 in response to
    student demand for a second course in data science; they wanted a course that
    would prepare them for advanced study in data science and for the workforce.

- en: 'The thousands of students we have taught since that first offering have been
    an inspiration for us. We’ve also benefited from co-teaching with other instructors,
    including Ani Adhikari, Andrew Bray, John DeNero, Sandrine Dudoit, Will Fithian,
    Joe Hellerstein, Josh Hug, Anthony Joseph, Scott Lee, Fernando Perez, Alvin Wan,
    Lisa Yan, and Bin Yu. We especially thank Joe Hellerstein for insights around
    data wrangling, Fernando Perez for encouraging us to include more complex data
    structures like NetCDF, Josh Hug for the idea of the PurpleAir case study, and
    Duncan Temple Lang for collaboration on an earlier version of the course. We also
    thank the Berkeley students who have been our teaching assistants, and especially
    mention those who have contributed to previous versions of the book: Ananth Agarwal,
    Ashley Chien, Andrew Do, Tiffany Jann, Sona Jeswani, Andrew Kim, Jun Seo Park,
    Allen Shen, Katherine Yen, and Daniel Zhu.'
