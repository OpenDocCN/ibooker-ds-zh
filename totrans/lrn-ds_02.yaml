- en: Data science is a rapidly evolving field. At the time of this writing, people
    are still trying to pin down exactly what data science is, what data scientists
    do, and what skills data scientists should have. What we do know, though, is that
    data science uses a combination of methods and principles from statistics and
    computer science to work with and draw insights from data. And learning computer
    science and statistics in combination makes us better data scientists. We also
    know that any insights we glean need to be interpreted in the context of the problem
    that we are working on.

    to help make all sorts of important decisions. With both technical skills and
    conceptual understanding we can work on data-centric problems to, say, assess
    whether a vaccine works, filter out fake news automatically, calibrate air quality
    sensors, and advise analysts on policy changes.

    a workflow that we call the *data science lifecycle*. In this chapter, we introduce
    this lifecycle. Unlike other data science books, which tend to focus on one part
    of the lifecycle or address only computational or statistical topics, we cover
    the entire cycle from start to finish and consider both statistical and computational
    aspects together.

    into four stages: Ask a Question, Obtain Data, Understand the Data, and Understand
    the World. We’ve purposefully made these stages broad. In our experience, the
    mechanics of the lifecycle change frequently. Computer scientists and statisticians
    continue to build new software packages and programming languages for working
    with data, and they develop new methodologies that are more specialized.'

    kinds of questions guides us in our analyses. We cover four categories of questions:
    descriptive, exploratory, inferential, and predictive. For example, “How have
    house prices changed over time?” is descriptive in nature, whereas “Which aspects
    of houses are related to sale price?” is exploratory. Narrowing down a broad question
    into one that can be answered with data is a key element of this first stage in
    the lifecycle. It can involve consulting the people participating in a study,
    figuring out how to measure something, and designing data collection protocols.
    A clear and focused research question helps us determine the data we need, the
    patterns to look for, and how to interpret results. It can also help us refine
    our question, recognize the type of question being asked, and plan the data collection
    phase of the lifecycle.'

- en: When data are expensive and hard to gather and when our goal is to generalize
    from the data to the world, we aim to define precise protocols for collecting
    the data. Other times, data are cheap and easily accessed. This is especially
    true for online data sources. For example, [Twitter](https://oreil.ly/WvUhe) lets
    people quickly download millions of data points. When data are plentiful, we can
    start an analysis by obtaining and exploring the data, and then honing a research
    question. In both situations, most data have missing or unusual values and other
    anomalies that we need to account for. No matter the source, we need to check
    the data quality. Considering the scope of the data is equally important; for
    example, we identify how representative the data are and look for potential sources
    of bias in the collection process. These considerations help us determine how
    much faith we can place in our findings. And, typically, we must manipulate the
    data before we can analyze it more formally. We may need to modify structure,
    clean data values, and transform measurements to prepare for analysis.

- en: After obtaining and preparing data, we want to carefully examine them, and *exploratory
    data analysis* is often key. In our explorations, we make plots to uncover interesting
    patterns and summarize the data visually. We also continue to look for problems
    with the data. As we search for patterns and trends, we use summary statistics
    and build statistical models, like linear and logistic regression. In our experience,
    this stage of the lifecycle is highly iterative. Understanding the data can also
    lead us back to earlier stages in the data science lifecycle. We may find that
    we need to modify or redo the data cleaning and manipulation, acquire more data
    to supplement our analysis, or refine our research question given the limitations
    of the data. The descriptive and exploratory analyses that we carry out in this
    stage may adequately answer our question, or we may need to go on to the next
    stage in order to make generalizations beyond our data.

- en: When our goals are purely descriptive or exploratory, the analysis ends at the
    Understand the Data stage of the lifecycle. At other times, we aim to quantify
    how well the trends we find generalize beyond our data. We may want to use a model
    that we have fit to our data to make inferences about the world or give predictions
    for future observations. To draw inferences from a sample to a population, we
    use statistical techniques like A/B testing and confidence intervals. And to make
    predictions for future observations, we create prediction intervals and use train-test
    splits of the data.

    data technologies and statistical methodologies, and show how they work in practical
    examples. Throughout, we rely on authentic data and analyses by other data scientists,
    not made-up data, so you can learn how to perform your own data acquisition, cleaning,
    exploration, and formal analyses, and draw sound conclusions. Each chapter in
    this book tends to focus on one stage of the data science lifecycle, but we also
    include chapters with case studies that demonstrate the full lifecycle.

    causation can be a challenge. We can easily slip into confusing a correlation
    found in data with a causal relationship. For example, an exploratory or inferential
    analysis might look for correlations in response to the question “Do people who
    have a greater exposure to air pollution have a higher rate of lung disease?”
    Whereas a causal question might ask “Does giving an award to a Wikipedia contributor
    increase productivity?” We typically cannot answer causal questions unless we
    have a randomized experiment (or approximate one). We point out these important
    distinctions throughout the book.

    throughout this book. These cases serve double duty. They focus on one stage in
    the lifecycle to provide a specific example of the topics in the part of the book
    where they are located, and they also demonstrate the entire cycle.

    of interest and how data can be used to answer the question. The simple question
    “Why is my bus always late?” provides a rich case study that is basic enough for
    the beginning data scientist to track the stages of the lifecycle, and yet nuanced
    enough to demonstrate how we apply both statistical and computational thinking
    to answer the question. In this case study, we build a simulation study to inform
    us about the distribution of wait times for riders. And we fit a simple model
    to summarize the wait times with a statistic. This case study also demonstrates
    how, as a data scientist, you can collect your own data to answer questions that
    interest you.

    that are used across the United States. We devise a way to leverage data from
    highly accurate sensors maintained by the Environmental Protection Agency to improve
    readings from less expensive sensors. This case study shows how crowdsourced,
    open data can be improved with data from rigorously maintained, precise, government-monitored
    equipment. In the process, we focus on cleaning and merging data from multiple
    sources, but we also fit models to adjust and improve air quality measurements.'

    But we cover the full lifecycle and see how the question of interest impacts the
    model that we build. Our aim is to enable veterinarians in rural Kenya, who have
    no access to a scale to weigh a donkey, to prescribe medication for a sick animal.
    As we learn about the design of the study, clean the data, and balance simplicity
    with accuracy, we assess the predictive capabilities of our model and show how
    scientists can partner with people facing practical problems and assist them with
    solutions.

    news stories in an effort to algorithmically differentiate fake news from real
    news. In this case study, we again see how readily accessible information creates
    amazing opportunities for data scientists to develop new technologies and investigate
    today’s important problems. These data have been scraped from news stories on
    the web and classified as fake or real news by people reading the stories. We
    also see how data scientists thinking creatively can take general information,
    such as the content of a news article, and transform it into analyzable data to
    address topical questions.

- en: The data science lifecycle provides an organizing structure for this book. We
    keep the lifecycle in mind as we work with many datasets from a wide range of
    sources, including science, medicine, politics, social media, and government.
    The first time we use a dataset, we provide the context in which the data were
    collected, the question of interest in examining the data, and descriptions needed
    to understand the data. In this way, we aim to practice good data science throughout
    the book.

- en: The first stage of the lifecycle—asking a question—is often seen in books as
    a question that requires an application of a technique to get a number, such as
    “What’s the *p*-value for this A/B test?” Or a vague question that is often seen
    in practice, like “Can we restore the American Dream?” Answering the first sort
    of question gives little practice in developing a research question. Answering
    the second is hard to do without guidance on how to turn a general area of interest
    into a question that can be answered with data. The interplay between asking a
    question and understanding the limitations of data to answer it is the topic of
    the next chapter.
