    done quickly in Excel by entering numbers into the first few rows of the column,
    then highlighting that range and using Flash Fill to complete the selection based
    on that pattern. Look for the small square on the bottom right-hand side of your

    By default, Excel will take the *sum* of the *id* field. It’s made the mistake
    of assuming a categorical variable to be quantitative. We cannot quantitatively
    compare ID numbers, but we *can* count their frequencies. To do this on Windows,
    click “Sum of id” in the Values area and select Value Field Settings. Under “Summarize
    value field by,” select “Count.” Click OK. For Mac, click the *i* icon next “Sum
    of id” to do this. Now we have what we want: the number of observations for each
    class type. This is known as a *one-way frequency table* and is shown in [Figure 1-6](#one-way-frequency-table).'

    and doubled that number at 25 and 100, respectively? Adjust the numbers in the
    menu; [Figure 1-15](#changing-histogram-bins) shows the results. I like to think
    of this as “zooming in and out” on the details of the distribution.

    are a sizable number of test scores to the extreme right of the distribution,
    but that most test scores are overwhelmingly in the 400–500 range.

    the three class sizes? Here, we are comparing a continuous variable across three
    levels of a categorical one. Setting this up with a histogram in Excel will take
    some “hacking,” but we can lean on PivotTables to get the job done.

    in terms of *quartiles*. The center of the boxplot is a measure you’re familiar
    with, the *median*.
  id: totrans-219
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As the “middle” of our dataset, one way to think about the median is as the
    second quartile. We can find the first and third quartiles by dividing our dataset
    evenly into quadrants and finding their midpoints. [Figure 1-18](#parts-of-boxplot)
    labels these various elements of a boxplot.

    range*. This range is used as the basis for deriving other parts of the plot.
    The remaining range that falls within 1.5 times the interquartile range is represented
    by two lines or “whiskers.” In fact, Excel refers to this type of chart as Box
    & Whisker.
  id: totrans-223

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Observations that aren’t found within this range are shown as individual dots
    on the plot. These are considered *outliers*. The boxplot may be more complex
    than the histogram, but fortunately Excel will handle all preparation for us.
    Let’s return to our *treadssk* example. Highlight this range, then from the ribbon
    select Insert → Box & Whisker.
  id: totrans-224
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We can see in [Figure 1-19](#boxplot-reading-scores) that our interquartile
    range falls within about 415 to 450, and that there are several outliers, especially
    on the high side. We noticed similar patterns about the data from the histogram,
    although we had a more visual perspective of the complete distribution, and were
    able to examine at different levels of granularity with different bin widths.
    Just like with the descriptive statistics, each visualization offers a unique
    perspective of the data; none is inherently superior to the others.

    where the quartiles of our data are located, and what observations are considered
    outliers. Another is that it can be easier to compare distributions across multiple
    groups. To make boxplots of multiple groups in Excel, it’s easiest to have the
    categorical variable of interest directly to the left of the continuous one. In
    this manner, move *classk* to the left of *treadssk* in your data source. With
    this data selected, click Insert → Box & Whisker from the ribbon. In [Figure 1-20](#boxplot-multiple-groups)
    we see that the general distribution of scores looks similar across the three
    groups.
