    data scientists in business. Indeed, randomizing the allocation of subjects between
    experimental groups allows us to negate any potential confounding without the
    need to even identify it.

    I would argue that several aspects of its approach make it both simpler and more
    powerful.

- en: First of all, recasting experiments within the causal-behavioral framework will
    allow you to create better and more effective experiments, and better understand
    the spectrum from observational to experimental data analysis instead of thinking
    of them as separate.

- en: Second, most books on A/B testing rely on statistical tests such as the T-test
    of means or the test of proportions. Instead, I’ll rely on our known workhorses,
    linear and logistic regressions, which will make our experiments simpler and more
    powerful.

    the tested intervention based on its p-value, which doesn’t lead to the best business
    decisions. Instead I’ll rely on the Bootstrap and its confidence intervals, which
    is progressively establishing itself as the best practice.

    what a “simple” A/B test looks like when using regression and the Bootstrap. That
    is, for each customer we toss a metaphorical coin. Heads and they see version
    A, tails and they see version B. That is often the only solution for website A/B
    testing.

    subjects, you can create more balanced experimental groups with stratification.
    This can significantly increase the power of your experiments, as I’ll show in
    [Chapter 9](ch09.xhtml#stratified_randomizatio).

- en: Finally, it happens quite often that you can’t randomize at the desired level.
    For example, you’re interested in the impact of a change on customers, but you
    must randomize at the level of call-center representatives. This requires cluster
    randomization and hierarchical modeling, which we’ll see in [Chapter 10](ch10.xhtml#cluster_randomization_and_hierarchical).
