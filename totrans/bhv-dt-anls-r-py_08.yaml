- en: Ideal data is large, complete, and regularly shaped (e.g., normally distributed
    in the case of numeric variables). This is the data you see in introductory stats
    courses. Real-life data is often less accommodating, especially when dealing with
    behavioral data.

    handle missing data. While missing data is a common occurrence in data analysis,
    behavioral data adds a layer of complexity: which values are missing is often
    correlated with individual characteristics and behaviors, and that introduces
    bias in our analyses. Fortunately, using CDs will allow us to identify and resolve
    such situations as well as possible.'

    about a type of computer simulation called the Bootstrap. It’s a very versatile
    tool that is particularly well suited to behavioral data analysis: it allows us
    to appropriately measure uncertainty around our estimates when dealing with small
    or weirdly shaped data. Moreover, when designing and analyzing experiments, it
    offers an alternative to p-values that will make our lives much simpler.'
