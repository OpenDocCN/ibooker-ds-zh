- en: This first part of the book provides a basic toolkit for the toolchain to come
    and is part tutorial, part reference. Given the fairly wide range of knowledge
    in the target audience, there will probably be things covered that you already
    know. My advice is just to cherry-pick the material to fill any gaps in your knowledge
    and maybe skim what you already know as a refresher.

    skip to the start of our journey along the toolchain in [Part II](part02.xhtml#part_getting_data).
