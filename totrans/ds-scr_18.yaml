    the site, with varying degrees of success. He’s collected a dataset consisting
    of several (qualitative) attributes of each candidate, as well as whether that
    candidate interviewed well or poorly. Could you, he asks, use this data to build
    a model identifying which candidates will interview well, so that he doesn’t have
    to waste time conducting interviews?

    and interpret, and the process by which they reach a prediction is completely
    transparent. Unlike the other models we’ve looked at so far, decision trees can
    easily handle a mix of numeric (e.g., number of legs) and categorical (e.g., delicious/not
    delicious) attributes and can even classify data for which attributes are missing.

    is computationally a very hard problem. (We will get around this by trying to
    build a good-enough tree rather than an optimal one, although for large datasets
    this can still be a lot of work.) More important, it is very easy (and very bad)
    to build decision trees that are *overfitted* to the training data, and that don’t
    generalize well to unseen data. We’ll look at ways to address this.

    this chapter, we’ll focus on classification trees, and we’ll work through the
    ID3 algorithm for learning a decision tree from a set of labeled data, which should
    help us understand how decision trees actually work. To make things simple, we’ll
    restrict ourselves to problems with binary outputs like “Should I hire this candidate?”
    or “Should I show this website visitor advertisement A or advertisement B?” or
    “Will eating this food I found in the office fridge make me sick?”

    ask and in what order. At each stage of the tree there are some possibilities
    we’ve eliminated and some that we haven’t. After learning that an animal doesn’t
    have more than five legs, we’ve eliminated the possibility that it’s a grasshopper.
    We haven’t eliminated the possibility that it’s a duck. Each possible question
    partitions the remaining possibilities according to its answer.

    “yes” answers always correspond to `True` outputs and “no” answers to `False`
    outputs (or vice versa), this would be an awesome question to pick. Conversely,
    a yes/no question for which neither answer gives you much new information about
    what the prediction should be is probably not a good choice.

    whose answer partitions data into one or (hopefully) more subsets. For instance,
    our “does it have more than five legs?” question partitions animals into those

    different values will result in a very low entropy due to overfitting. For example,
    imagine you work for a bank and are trying to build a decision tree to predict
    which of your customers are likely to default on their mortgages, using some historical
    data as your training set. Imagine further that the dataset contains each customer’s
    Social Security number. Partitioning on SSN will produce one-person subsets, each
    of which necessarily has zero entropy. But a model that relies on SSN is *certain*
    not to generalize beyond the training set. For this reason, you should probably
    try to avoid (or bucket, if appropriate) attributes with large numbers of possible
    values when creating decision trees.

    using different data, each tree will be different from every other tree. (A side
    benefit is that it’s totally fair to use the nonsampled data to test each tree,
    which means you can get away with using all of your data as the training set if
    you are clever in how you measure performance.) This technique is known as *bootstrap
    aggregating* or *bagging*.'
