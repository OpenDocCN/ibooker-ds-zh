    segment users into groups based on their mobile browsing behavior. In chapter
    12, we took over another analyst’s work, verified their findings, and continued
    analyzing our customers’ behavior. We turned an event-level dataset into a user-level
    one, and in this chapter, we will apply a clustering algorithm to create distinct
    user segments. We will evaluate these segments and address our stakeholders’ questions.
    Let’s recap the project before continuing.

    of “close together” requires a numeric measurement of distance. If one of our
    columns is on a larger scale than the others, then that column will dominate our
    clusters. In our case, if we use the data as is, it is most likely that users
    will be segmented only by the number of sessions because that is the column with
    the largest variation. If all columns are within approximately the same range,
    they will contribute equally to the clusters.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are different scaling methods we could use. One typical approach is to
    transform data points into z-scores, meaning they will be measured by the distance,
    in standard deviations, to the mean value of that column. All data scaled this
    way will be approximately in the range from –5 to 5, regardless of the underlying
    units. If a user has a “number of sessions” value of 1 after transformation, it
    means their value of the number of sessions is one standard deviation above the
    mean number of sessions for a user. This is then directly comparable against a
    value of 1 for the number of apps, even though the two measures might be on different
    scales.

    It’s a distance-based method that groups points into the same cluster if they
    are close together in data space. It tries to find a solution where points within
    a cluster are as close together as possible, but clusters are as far away from
    each other as possible. That means groups should be as homogeneous as possible
    internally but otherwise differ from each other. Let’s add this decision to our

    to choose the number of groups up front. This is not straightforward, as we might
    not have any intuition about what number makes sense for our current case. One
    method for finding the right ballpark for the number of clusters is referred to
    as the “elbow method.” This means empirically trying different numbers of groups
    and seeing where the benefits of adding another group start to tail off.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We will run a k-means clustering algorithm with different numbers of groups
    and measure something called the “inertia,” which measures how closely points
    are to their cluster centers. A low inertia value means a better clustering structure.
    Bear in mind, however, that adding more groups *always* *lowers* the inertia because
    having more cluster centers means points are more likely to be close to one. Typically,
    we find the point where adding another cluster does not significantly lower the
    inertia score.

    significantly decreases the inertia value, but this pattern does not continue.
    In figure 13.7, going from seven to eight clusters barely reduces the inertia
    score. Most of the time, these plots look like arms, and we’re looking for the
    elbow, the inflection point, after which the slope of the line flatlines. In the
    case of figure 13.7, we will use seven as the inflection point and, therefore,
    start with seven clusters. Figure 13.8 shows the process with this latest decision

    Getting real-time feedback from an audience is extremely valuable for improving
    as a presenter. Another related way is to give talks at meetups and conferences.
    This will help you practice communicating your expertise in a topic with confidence.
    Finally, building a project portfolio can be valuable in discussions with hiring
    managers.

    enough for further iterations. One idea might be to infer a user’s mobile operating
    system. If they used the Google app, they’re likely on an Android device, whereas
    using Apple apps would mean they’re on iOS. This distinction might change the
    makeup of our user segments.

    We could look at time spent on individual apps, number of times apps are opened
    and closed, whether there is variation in how often people switch apps, and so
    on. All of these considerations could give us richer user segments to explore.

    start and end cleanly. Sometimes, a session ends with an “Opened” event, and another
    starts just a few minutes later. If we wanted to explore sessions and events in
    more detail, we would want to clean up those sessions in more depth.
