- en: I am exceptionally proud of the first edition of *Data Science from Scratch*.
    It turned out very much the book I wanted it to be. But several years of developments
    in data science, of progress in the Python ecosystem, and of personal growth as
    a developer and educator have *changed* what I think a first book in data science
    should look like.

- en: Accordingly, I’ve rewritten all the code and examples using Python 3.6 (and
    many of its newly introduced features, like type annotations). I’ve woven into
    the book an emphasis on writing clean code. I’ve replaced some of the first edition’s
    toy examples with more realistic ones using “real” datasets. I’ve added new material
    on topics such as deep learning, statistics, and natural language processing,
    corresponding to things that today’s data scientists are likely to be working
    with. (I’ve also removed some material that seems less relevant.) And I’ve gone
    over the book with a fine-toothed comb, fixing bugs, rewriting explanations that
    are less clear than they could be, and freshening up some of the jokes.

- en: First, I would like to thank Mike Loukides for accepting my proposal for this
    book (and for insisting that I pare it down to a reasonable size). It would have
    been very easy for him to say, “Who’s this person who keeps emailing me sample
    chapters, and how do I get him to go away?” I’m grateful he didn’t. I’d also like
    to thank my editors, Michele Cronin and Marie Beaugureau, for guiding me through
    the publishing process and getting the book in a much better state than I ever
    would have gotten it on my own.

- en: I couldn’t have written this book if I’d never learned data science, and I probably
    wouldn’t have learned data science if not for the influence of Dave Hsu, Igor
    Tatarinov, John Rauser, and the rest of the Farecast gang. (So long ago that it
    wasn’t even called data science at the time!) The good folks at Coursera and DataTau
    deserve a lot of credit, too.

- en: I am also grateful to my beta readers and reviewers. Jay Fundling found a ton
    of mistakes and pointed out many unclear explanations, and the book is much better
    (and much more correct) thanks to him. Debashis Ghosh is a hero for sanity-checking
    all of my statistics. Andrew Musselman suggested toning down the “people who prefer
    R to Python are moral reprobates” aspect of the book, which I think ended up being
    pretty good advice. Trey Causey, Ryan Matthew Balfanz, Loris Mularoni, Núria Pujol,
    Rob Jefferson, Mary Pat Campbell, Zach Geary, Denise Mauldin, Jimmy O’Donnell,
    and Wendy Grus also provided invaluable feedback. Thanks to everyone who read
    the first edition and helped make this a better book. Any errors remaining are
    of course my responsibility.

    of new concepts, introducing me to a lot of great people, and making me feel like
    enough of an underachiever that I went out and wrote a book to compensate. Special
    thanks to Trey Causey (again), for (inadvertently) reminding me to include a chapter
    on linear algebra, and to Sean J. Taylor, for (inadvertently) pointing out a couple
    of huge gaps in the “Working with Data” chapter.'

    than writing a book is living with someone who’s writing a book, and I couldn’t
    have pulled it off without their support.
