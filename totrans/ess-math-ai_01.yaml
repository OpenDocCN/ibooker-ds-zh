    of our lives and is increasingly involved in making very important decisions.
    Soon it will be employed in every sector of our society, powering most of our
    daily operations. The technology is advancing very fast and its investments are
    skyrocketing. At the same time, it feels like we are in the middle of an AI frenzy.
    Everyday we hear about a new AI accomplishment: AI beats the best human player
    at Go game. AI outperforms human vision in classification tasks. AI makes deep
    fakes. AI generates high energy physics data. AI solves difficult partial differential
    equations that model the natural phenomena of the world. Self-driving cars are
    on the roads. Delivery drones are hovering in some parts of the world. We also
    hear about AI’s seemingly unlimited potential: AI will revolutionalize healthcare
    and education. AI will eliminate global hunger. AI will fight climate change.
    AI will save endangered species. AI will battle disease. AI will optimize the
    supply chain. AI will unravel the origins of life. AI will map the observable
    universe. Our cities and homes will be smart. Eventually, we cross into science
    fiction territory: Humans will upload their brains into computers. Humans will

    emotions, such as love, closeness, happiness, pride, dignity, caring, sadness,

  zh: 对于某个AI任务，有时会有许多方法或算法来完成它。每个任务、数据集和/或算法都有可以在实施过程中进行调整的参数，称为超参数，并不总是清楚这些超参数的最佳值是什么。可用于解决特定AI任务的方法和超参数的多样性意味着不同的方法可能会产生非常不同的结果，人们需要评估依赖哪种方法的决定。在某些应用中，例如为某个客户推荐哪种服装风格，这些差异可能是微不足道的。在其他领域，基于AI的决策可能会改变生活：患者被告知他们没有某种疾病，而实际上他们确实患有；一个人被错误地标记为极有可能再次犯罪，并因此被拒绝假释；或者一个合格的人被拒绝贷款。关于如何解决这些问题的研究正在进行中，随着我们在整本书中的进展，我将对这些问题进行更多的扩展。

    their biological bodies, the resources available on Earth and in the universe,
    that they are able to manipulate. These are again limited by the power and capacity
    of their brains. AI systems are similarly limited by the computing power and hardware
    capability of the systems supporting the AI’s software. Recent studies have suggested
    that computation-hungry deep learning is approaching its computational limits,
    and new ideas are needed to improve algorithm and hardware efficiency, or discover
    entirely new methods. Progress in AI has heavily depended on large increases in
    computing power. This power, however, is not unlimited, extremely costly for large
    systems processing massive data sets, and has a substantial carbon footprint that
    cannot be ignored. Moreover, data and algorithmic software do not exist in the
    vacuum. Devices such as computers, phones, tablets, batteries, and the warehouses
    and systems needed to store, transfer and process data and algorithms are made
    of real physical materials harvested from Earth. It took Earth millions of years
    to make some of these materials and the type of infinite supply required to forever
    sustain these technologies is just not there.

    rules of reasoning about these facts. There was no emphasis on the learning process.

    The more data a machine learning system is able to handle and process, the better
    its performance. Data, and the ability to process and *learn from* large amounts

    learning algorithms in that time period were Support Vector Machines, Bayesian

    the Imitation Game, was introduced in 1950 by Alan Turing, a computer scientist,
    cryptanalyst, mathematician and theoretical biologist, in his paper *Computing
    Machinery and Intelligence*. Turing proposed that a machine posseses artificial
    intelligence if its responses are indistiguishable from those of a human. Thus,
    a machine is considered intelligent if it is able to imitate human responses.
    The Turing Test, however, for a person outside the field of computer science,
