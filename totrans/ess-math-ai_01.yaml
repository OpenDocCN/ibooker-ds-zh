    of our lives and is increasingly involved in making very important decisions.
    Soon it will be employed in every sector of our society, powering most of our
    daily operations. The technology is advancing very fast and its investments are
    skyrocketing. At the same time, it feels like we are in the middle of an AI frenzy.
    Everyday we hear about a new AI accomplishment: AI beats the best human player
    at Go game. AI outperforms human vision in classification tasks. AI makes deep
    fakes. AI generates high energy physics data. AI solves difficult partial differential
    equations that model the natural phenomena of the world. Self-driving cars are
    on the roads. Delivery drones are hovering in some parts of the world. We also
    hear about AI’s seemingly unlimited potential: AI will revolutionalize healthcare
    and education. AI will eliminate global hunger. AI will fight climate change.
    AI will save endangered species. AI will battle disease. AI will optimize the
    supply chain. AI will unravel the origins of life. AI will map the observable
    universe. Our cities and homes will be smart. Eventually, we cross into science
    fiction territory: Humans will upload their brains into computers. Humans will

    optimal strategies and allocation of resources. The health industry suffers a
    severe shortage of doctors and AI has inumerable applications and unlimited potential
    there. Worldwide financial systems, stock markets and banking industries have
    always depended heavily on our ability to make good predictions, and have suffered
    tremendously when those predictions failed. Scientific research has progressed
    significantly with our increasing ability to compute, and today we are at a new
    dawn where advances in AI enable computations at scales thought impossible a few
    decades ago. Efficient systems and operations are needed everywhere, from the
    power grid to transportation to the supply chain to forest and wildlife preservation,
    battling world hunger, disease, and climate change. Automation is even sought
    after in AI itself, where an AI system spontaneously decides on the optimal pipelines,
    algorithms and parameters, readily producing the desired outcomes for given tasks,

    more basic and primitive survival functions such as breathing, regulating the

    we humans consider ourselves uniquely intelligent. Even though AI has outperformed
    humans in innumerable tasks, it cannot naturally switch and adapt to new tasks.
    For example, an AI system trained to recognize humans in images cannot recognize
    cats without retraining, or generate text without changing its architecture and
    algorithms. In the context of *the three types* of AI, we have thus far only partially
    accomplished Artificial Narrow Intelligence, which has a narrow range of abilities.
    We have neither accomplished Artificial General Intelligence, on par with human
    abilities, nor Artificial Super Intelligence, which is more capable than humans.
    Moreover, machines today are incapable of experiencing any of the beautiful human
    emotions, such as love, closeness, happiness, pride, dignity, caring, sadness,
    loss, and many others. Mimicking emotions is different than experiencing and genuinely
    providing them. In this sense, machines are nowhere close to replacing humans.

    AI-based decisions can be life changing: A patient is told they do not have a

    entirely new methods. Progress in AI has heavily depended on large increases in
    computing power. This power, however, is not unlimited, extremely costly for large

    the Imitation Game, was introduced in 1950 by Alan Turing, a computer scientist,
    cryptanalyst, mathematician and theoretical biologist, in his paper *Computing
    Machinery and Intelligence*. Turing proposed that a machine posseses artificial
    intelligence if its responses are indistiguishable from those of a human. Thus,
    a machine is considered intelligent if it is able to imitate human responses.

    of intelligence you are developing or using. Is it perception? Vision? Natural
    language? Navigation? Control? Reasoning? *Etc.* Which mathematics to focus on
    and why then follow naturally, since you already know where in the AI field you
    are situated. It will then be easy to attend to the mathematical methods and tools
    used by the community developing that particular aspect of AI. The recipe in this
    book is similar: First the AI type and application, then the math.'

    able to do? What are AI’s limitations? Where is AI headed? How does AI work? We
    also briefly surveyed important AI applications, the problems usually encountered
    by companies trying to integrate AI into their systems, incidents that happen
    when systems are not well implemented, and the math subjects typically needed
    for AI implementations.'

    to AI. When we talk data, we also talk data distributions, and that plunges us
    straight into probability theory and statistics.
