    multiple regression. The interpretation of the coefficient of the treatment variable
    ‘i94’ is *ceteris paribus*, that is, the impact of Islamic major on high school
    attainment considering everything else constant. The trick here is the “everything
    else constant” that means only the factors that is controlled in the regression.
    This is an imperfect solution, because in practical terms, it is not possible
    to control for all factors that affect the outcome variable. However, compared
    to the simple regression, the multiple regression is likely to suffer less from
    the omitted variable bias.

    was fitted to the control group (5 bins), and an orange line was fitted to the
    treatment group (5 bins). Now, the discontinuity or jump is clear. We call this
    method Regression Discontinuity (RD). The red vertical line (\(\hat{\tau}_{rd}=3.5\)%)
    is the increase of high school completion. Note that this method mimics an experiment.
    The municipalities where the Islamic party barely won and barely lost are likely
    to be similar to each other. The intuition is that “barely won” and “barely lost”
    is a random process like flip a coin. The reverse result in the election could
    occur at random. By the other hand, it is hard to imagine that Islamic mayors
    could lose in the municipalities where they won by a stronger margin of 30%.
