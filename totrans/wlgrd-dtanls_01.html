<p>Now that you have been introduced to the results-driven approach, let’s apply it to a real data science task. We will tackle a real-world problem and apply the results-driven method to it. It is a template for approaching the other projects and any other project you encounter in the future.</p>

<div class="readable-text" id="p7">
<p>Jupyter is a development environment that allows the mixing of code and accompanying text in the form of notebooks. Notebook files let you read the text and run the code directly within the document. They are popular for education and data analysis.</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p8">
<p>The notebooks accompanying the book collect the code snippets from each chapter into a single document where the code is also runnable. Sites such as GitHub even let you view the notebooks in the browser without requiring Jupyter to be installed. See the appendix for instructions on how to install Python to run the code yourself.</p>

<div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p9">
<p>For this chapter’s project, let’s examine an example task that analysts encounter, which at first glance might seem simple enough—encoding geography.</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p10">
<h2 class="readable-text-h2" id="sigil_toc_id_16"><span class="num-string">2.1</span> Project 1: Identifying customer geographies</h2>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p11">
<p>Let’s look at the project in which we will extract location information from free text to better understand our customer base. As an analyst for ProWidget Systems, a UK-based B2B (business-to-business) retailer, you’ve been asked to report on spending volumes for London-based customers versus those based in the rest of the United Kingdom. The board has supplied a high-level data extract containing all customers’ addresses and their total spending to date. They want to know</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li class="readable-text" id="p12"> Which UK cities are currently underserved </li>
<li class="readable-text" id="p13"> Whether their customers are primarily London based </li>
</ul>
<div class="readable-text" id="p14">
<p>If this were a sanitized tutorial, your data would likely have a column called <code>city</code>, and your task would be more about the technical steps required to group the data by city and summarize it using an appropriate metric. Perhaps you would take the total spending from all London-based customers and compare it against the same figure from other major cities in the United Kingdom or all data where the <code>city</code> column is not London. Perhaps you would choose to show the distribution instead to get a more detailed picture of the difference. Either way, your choice is more about the specific <em>technical</em> steps required to get an answer.</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p15">
<p>Compare this to answering the same question as an analyst in a real business. For instance, in this project, the available data is not organized cleanly enough to have a <code>city</code> column: we only have a single <code>customer</code> <code>address</code> column, which may or may not contain the city somewhere within it. The address data for this project comes from Companies House, an executive agency sponsored by the UK government’s Department for Business and Trade. The original public data, which I modified for this exercise, is available at <a href="https://mng.bz/mGxr">https://mng.bz/mGxr</a>. </p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p16">
<p>Before doing any analysis, we need to decide how to identify what city an address relates to. We will follow the results-driven process laid out in chapter 1 to do this and get an answer for our stakeholders.</p>

</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p18">
<p>As a data scientist, one data-driven tool I built was a map of all our customers combined with a list of all companies in the United Kingdom that were in a relevant industry to be our potential customers. The sales team used this map to identify prospective customers in the local area whenever they went to visit an existing customer.</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p19">
<p>The project involved combining our own customer data with the government’s official public list of companies, and the bulk of the work was sanitizing address data in both lists so they could be compared, which is why that is the topic of this chapter.</p>

</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p26">
<p>In this section, I will dive into an example solution, focusing on the steps of the results-driven approach, as well as the details of solving the problem. You may wish to attempt this problem yourself before going further or use this chapter to get a feel for the structure of the rest of the projects. As for most solutions I provide, the code itself will be written in Python, primarily using the <code>pandas</code> library. While code snippets will be used to explain the example solution, I will focus discussions on the conceptual solution and less on the code specifics. The solution will have three parts: setting up the problem statement and the data, creating the first iteration of a solution, and reviewing the work and deciding on further steps.</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p27">
<h3 class="readable-text-h3" id="sigil_toc_id_19"><span class="num-string">2.2.1</span> Setting ourselves up for success</h3>
</div>
<div class="browsable-container figure-container" id="p28">
<img alt="figure" height="175" src="../Images/2-unnumb-1.png" width="529"/>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p29">
<p><em><span class="aframe-location"/></em>The first step is to ensure we understand the problem. In this case, we know we need to use our customer address data to calculate the total spending by city across the United Kingdom and come up with an answer for how London customers compare with the rest of the country. If we encountered multiple metrics in the data, such as the number of transactions a customer has made or how long they have been a customer, we would need to clarify the purpose of the question with our stakeholders so that we know which metrics to focus on.</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p30">
<p>In this case, the data provided does not contain this ambiguity; it is clear we are focusing on spending patterns across two predefined geographic areas. However, had our stakeholders asked us about which areas are underserved in general, we would also seek to understand whether we should look at data at a city level or a different level of granularity.</p>
</div>
<div class="browsable-container figure-container" id="p31">
<img alt="figure" height="175" src="../Images/2-unnumb-2.png" width="529"/>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p32">
<p><em><span class="aframe-location"/></em>The crucial step in any analysis is to think of where we are going. What form will a minimum viable answer take? In this example, our stakeholders have two questions:</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li class="readable-text" id="p33"> <em>Are different cities underserved?</em> This requires us to calculate total customer spending by city and find cities with the lowest customer spending. </li>
<li class="readable-text" id="p34"> <em>How does London compare to the rest of the United Kingdom?</em> This can then be answered from the output of the first answer. </li>
</ul>
<div class="readable-text" id="p35">
<p>For a minimum viable answer to exist, we need to add a <code>city</code> column to our data, which we will extract from the address. This will allow us to have a breakdown of spending by city, meaning we could take the row for London and compare it against the rest of the table. As for the final output, a table or a bar chart will suffice for both cases. It may seem obvious, but knowing the exact format of our output will guide us toward a relevant solution, which is a table containing one row per city and an associated total spending figure.<em/></p>
</div>
<div class="browsable-container figure-container" id="p36">
<img alt="figure" height="175" src="../Images/2-unnumb-3.png" width="529"/>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p37">
<p><em><span class="aframe-location"/></em>To tackle any analytical question, we need to know what data is required to answer it. To get city-level customer figures, we need data on which city each customer belongs to. This requires that each customer record has a <code>city</code> column, or at least some sort of address data, against it. We know in this case that an address field has been provided, so we have sufficient data to attempt the problem, even if we are unsure at this stage whether we can get a satisfactory answer. In this step, we also decide on additional data sources we might need. In this case, it might be to enhance the accuracy of our address data. Our first iteration should usually focus on the data we already have, and additional data sources can be considered in future iterations.</p>
</div>
<div class="browsable-container figure-container" id="p38">

</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p39">
<p><em><span class="aframe-location"/></em>The step of acquiring data should not be underestimated. Entire data science initiatives have failed because the data science team never received any usable data to analyze. The obstacles to obtaining data are not technical but organizational, and it is one aspect of the real world we won’t simulate. Throughout the projects, you will not need to find any data yourself; it will be provided. It will not always be easy to clean, but you will not spend any time emailing someone in your organization and hoping for their goodwill to send you a data extract!</p>

<div class="readable-text" id="p42">
<p><em><span class="aframe-location"/></em>By this point, we have established the problem statement and obtained all necessary data. It is now time to explore the dataset before extracting the city component of each address and summarizing customer spending data by city. Let’s start by importing the necessary libraries and reading in the data:</p>
</div>
<div class="browsable-container listing-container" id="p43">
<div class="code-area-container">
<pre class="code-area">import pandas as pd
customers = pd.read_csv("./data/addresses.csv")
print(customers.shape)</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p44">
<p>The output is <code>(100000, 3)</code>, meaning we have a total of 100,000 rows of data and the three columns we saw in the data dictionary. Before extracting any city data, we should check for missing values.</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p45">
<h4 class="readable-text-h4 sigil_not_in_toc">Investigating missing values</h4>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p46">
<p>Depending on your tool of choice, attempting to extract data from empty addresses may yield errors. The output of the following code snippet is shown in figure 2.2:</p>
</div>
<div class="browsable-container listing-container" id="p47">
<div class="code-area-container">
<pre class="code-area">customers.isnull().sum()<span class="aframe-location"/></pre>

<h5 class="figure-container-h5 sigil_not_in_toc"><span class="num-string">Figure 2.2</span> A table showing the number of missing values per column</h5>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p49">
<p>We can see there are 968 missing addresses, which is just under 1% of our rows. Since we have no way of knowing the addresses of those missing customers just from the data provided, we can safely drop these rows:</p>
</div>
<div class="browsable-container listing-container" id="p50">
<div class="code-area-container">
<pre class="code-area">customers = customers.dropna(subset=["address"])</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p51">
<p>What percentage of rows is acceptable to drop will depend on the context, but losing 1% due to missing key information is fine. If, say, 10% of our customers had missing addresses, we might want to examine why.</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p52">
<p>However, this is a point where analyses might diverge. The missing address data could either be kept and categorized simply as “Other” or, if we had more customer-related data, we may choose to spend the time looking up a customer’s address elsewhere to get a more complete dataset.</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p53">
<p>There are many places in an analysis where there is no definitive right decision, only different decisions based on different assumptions. Because of this, your analysis will diverge from mine at various points. Figure 2.3 illustrates this branching of possible paths in a diagram, which I will use heavily to reiterate this point.<span class="aframe-location"/></p>

</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p55">
<p>There are two types of shapes: steps and decisions. Steps represent sequential tasks to be undertaken in the analysis. These come from the original action plan but may also be informed by what we find in the data. Decisions represent places where the analysis might diverge, depending on the assumptions and choices made. Your analysis will not necessarily contain the same steps or the same decisions as mine.</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p56">
<p>While we are exploring our columns, we should also check if our <code>total_spend</code> column contains any strange values, such as negatives. The output of the following code snippet is shown in figure 2.4:</p>
</div>
<div class="browsable-container listing-container" id="p57">
<div class="code-area-container">
<pre class="code-area">customers["total_spend"].describe()<span class="aframe-location"/></pre>

</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p59">
<p>As the figure shows, the values range from 0 to just under £12,000 with no negative values. Now that we have seen our data, we need to decide on an approach to extract the information about cities. Let’s think back to our two stakeholder questions: “Are different cities underserved?” and “How does London compare to the rest of the United Kingdom?” The second question is a subset of the first. That is, once you have a dataset of customer spending by city, it is easy to compare London against other cities. To solve one question means solving the other, so if we start by focusing on identifying addresses in London first, we can find the nuances and edge cases of how addresses are represented.</p>

<div class="readable-text" id="p60">
<h4 class="readable-text-h4 sigil_not_in_toc">Extracting city column from addresses</h4>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p61">
<p>Before deciding on a method, we should look at some sample addresses. The following code prints the first five addresses, the output of which is shown in figure 2.5:</p>
</div>
<div class="browsable-container listing-container" id="p62">
<div class="code-area-container">
<pre class="code-area">for address in customers["address"].head():
    print(address, "\n")<span class="aframe-location"/></pre>

</div>
<div class="browsable-container figure-container" id="p63">
<img alt="figure" height="820" src="../Images/2-5.png" width="460"/>
<h5 class="figure-container-h5 sigil_not_in_toc"><span class="num-string">Figure 2.5</span> Five sample addresses</h5>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p64">
<p>We can already notice some patterns, as well as some potential pitfalls. From our limited sample, it appears that addresses end with the postcode, but sometimes London addresses contain a line for England, and sometimes they don’t. This means we cannot rely on looking at a specific row of an address to give us the city, which is useful information.</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p65">
<p>What about looking for the string “London” to identify customers in London? Would that be sufficient? Probably not. You would end up including people who live on “London Road” in other towns, for a start. Examining the data, we can see that address lines are separated by a comma and a new line character, so looking for <code>"LONDON,"</code> could alleviate this particular problem. Note the extra comma in the search string. Our rule could simply be the following: if one of the rows of an address is “London,” then that address is a London one. In our sample, all addresses were uppercase, but we should not assume this will be the case for all 100,000 rows, so we should ensure they are all uppercase ourselves. To compare our cleaned address data with the original, we will create a new column to store the cleaned version. It is usually a good idea to keep data in its raw form somewhere to reference as needed:</p>
</div>
<div class="browsable-container listing-container" id="p66">
<div class="code-area-container">
<pre class="code-area">customers["address_clean"] = customers["address"].str.upper()</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p67">
<p>Now that we have ensured that the casing is consistent, we can investigate the difference between looking for <code>"LONDON"</code> and <code>"LONDON,"</code>:</p>
</div>
<div class="browsable-container listing-container" id="p68">
<div class="code-area-container">
<pre class="code-area">len(customers[customers["address_clean"].str.contains("LONDON")])
len(customers[customers["address_clean"].str.contains("LONDON,")])</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p69">
<p>The output of these lines of code is <code>21,768</code> and <code>20,831</code>, respectively, which means nearly 1,000 rows are no longer selected when we add the commas. Those are the addresses that contain the word London, but we assume are not, in fact, in the city of London (e.g., addresses on London Road). We have already seen from our sample addresses that we cannot rely on the position of a row to decide where the city component is. However, there may only be a finite number of address structures. Let’s look at how many addresses consist of how many rows. The output of this code is shown in figure 2.6:</p>
</div>
<div class="browsable-container listing-container" id="p70">
<div class="code-area-container">
<pre class="code-area">customers["address_lines"] = (
    customers["address_clean"]

     #1 Splits an address into a list of substrings (i.e., separate the rows)
     <br/>#2 Counts the length of each list (i.e., the number of rows in the address)

<p>We can observe that some addresses consist of only one or two lines, and some have as many as six. In theory, if every three-line, four-line, five-line, and so forth address is consistent, we could come up with a rule to extract the city slightly differently from each. We should also examine some of these shorter addresses to see what they look like. The output of this code is shown in figures 2.7 and 2.8, respectively:</p>

<p>These figures show the variability of our data. Some rows are simply a city, Falkirk; there are entirely missing addresses referring us to a parent registry; and we also have PO Box addresses.

</div>
<div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p77">
<p>Let’s remind ourselves of our goal: our immediate task is to create a <code>city</code> column, and we now have to decide how to proceed. One option is to take our London-finding example and extend it by explicitly looking for city names in the <code>address</code> column. This would require a comprehensive list of cities in the United Kingdom, which is not an impossible task. Such lists exist—for example, the list available at <a href="https://mng.bz/5gKB">https://mng.bz/5gKB</a> is provided by the UK government. In this case, we would still need to decide what to do with addresses that fall outside of these cities. Do we simply label them “Other”? For a first iteration, this may suffice, as the question was specifically asking about cities, not towns or villages.</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p78">
<p>Another option is to use the postcode component of each address and look it up against a national postcode database, which we would have to obtain and ensure we are allowed to use. This might be a more accurate method but would require additional work, such as identifying the postcode component of each address in the first place.</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p79">
<p>In general, we should err on the side of less effort for our first iteration, so we will attempt to use the list of cities in the UK provided by the UK government.

The simplest one is to copy and paste the bullet points from the website directly into Excel, so each city is on a separate line, and then import and clean the data in our code. The quickest option isn’t always to write code! However, for full reproducibility, you may want to automate that step. Obtaining this data manually will suit us here since we don’t expect the list of UK cities to change very often.

<p>There are clearly some aspects of this data to clean before using it as a definitive list of cities. First, the country headings were included as rows in the data, so the values <code>England</code>, <code>Scotland</code>, <code>Wales</code>, and <code>Northern</code> <code>Ireland</code> need to be removed. Then, the trailing asterisk <code>*</code> character also needs to be trimmed, and the remaining city names should be uppercased to match our address data.

<div class="readable-text" id="p90">
<p>We can use our city list to tag an address with a particular city if that city name and an additional comma are found somewhere in the address. Using figure 2.11 as an example, we will assume that an address that contains the substring <code>"BATH,"</code> is an address in the city of Bath, so the value in the <code>city</code> column will be <code>"BATH"</code>. Anything where this newly created <code>city</code> column doesn’t have a value, where none of the city names was found in the address, will be categorized as <code>"OTHER"</code>. The following code achieves this, and figure 2.13 shows the latest state of our data:</p>

<p>Over half of our data is in the “Other” category, which means half of our customer base is established outside of major cities. This is an important insight to communicate to our stakeholders. Let’s look at some addresses from this category, as shown in figure 2.15:</p>

<div class="readable-text" id="p101">
<p>Some of these addresses relate to towns, but there is an address in Twickenham, which is a suburban district in London. While the address did not contain the word “London,” that customer should be categorized as being London based. We can already see some of the shortfalls of our chosen approach. At this point, we note them down and may consider tackling them in a future iteration.</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text print-book-callout" id="p102">
<p><span class="print-book-callout-head">Note</span>  Unless you have knowledge of UK geography, you may miss these instances of London addresses without the word “London” in them. This highlights how important domain knowledge is for an analyst and why you should work closely with domain experts.</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p103">
<p>One sanity check at this point is to see how many unique cities are in the government data and our tagged address data. Depending on the business, we might assume that we have at least one customer in every major UK city, and we can verify this. A Python trick is to create a unique set of the government’s city list and the list of unique cities in our new <code>city</code> column and subtract one set from the other. <span class="aframe-location"/>This will give us the difference between the lists, that is, cities that appear in the government list but not in our address data:</p>

<p>The output of this code is the string <code>{'KINGSTON-UPON-HULL'}</code>, which tells us that the city Kingston-upon-Hull is not in the <code>city</code> column of our customer address data. This either means we have no customers there, which is not impossible given its population is only around 250,000, or there is something else going on. The city is usually abbreviated to just “Hull,” which again is a case of applying specific domain knowledge to the problem, so let’s look for that in our address data:</p>

</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p116">
<p>It is clear that the “Other” category dominates. As we have seen before, our customers are just as likely to be based outside of a major city. This is partly down to how cities are defined in the United Kingdom. There are only 76 that are officially called “cities,” but there are many “towns” with significant populations. This distinction between towns and cities partly explains why the “Other” category is so large.</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p117">
<p>Another observation is that London does indeed come out as the top city in terms of customer spending, as well as the number of customers. The next largest cities in terms of spending, Manchester and Birmingham, are also the next largest by population. The top cities in both this chart and our customer volume calculation in figure 2.14 generally correspond to the top cities by population. Leeds is perhaps lower than you would expect based on its population, but there is no reason customer spending figures should correlate perfectly with population.</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p118">
<p>Our final inquiry is to compare London against the rest of the United Kingdom. We can take this to mean either “all of the United Kingdom that isn’t London” or “all major cities except London.” We should calculate both figures and decide how to report our findings:</p>
</div>
<div class="browsable-container listing-container" id="p119">
<div class="code-area-container code-area-with-html">
<pre class="code-area">print("Total spend for all customers:")
print(customers["total_spend"].sum())

print("Total spend for London customers:")
print(customers.loc[customers["city"] == "LONDON", "total_spend"].sum())

print("Total spend outside London:")
print(customers.loc[customers["city"] != "LONDON", "total_spend"].sum())

print("Total spend outside London (excluding OTHER):")
print(customers.loc[customers["city"].isin(["LONDON", "OTHER"]) == False,
<span class="">↪</span> "total_spend"].sum())</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p120">
<p>The output of this code tells us the total spending across our customers was £490M. This breaks down into £103M for London customers and £387M for the rest of the United Kingdom. If we look at all major cities outside London, the total is £119M. That is, if we compare London to other cities, we can see that our London customers generate nearly as much revenue as all other major cities combined. It does appear that our customer base is London-centric.</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p121">
<p>This gets us our minimum viable answer, except we haven’t fully answered the question of whether certain cities are underserved. Figure 2.17 shows us that the largest cities produce the highest amount of customer spend. To understand whether a city is being underserved, we would need to know more about what we would base that on. This would require a conversation with our stakeholders to understand whether they are missing any cities they expected to see among the highest-spending ones shown in figure 2.17. Before we move on, let’s review all the steps we took in this analysis (figure 2.18).<span class="aframe-location"/></p>

<div class="readable-text" id="p126">
<p><em><span class="aframe-location"/></em>After cleaning our data and extracting city information, we have arrived at an answer to our analytical questions. Our customers spend the most in bigger cities since there are generally more customers in larger cities, and London generates nearly as much income as all the other cities combined. This insight, coupled with the table in figure 2.14 and the chart from figure 2.17, would fit on one or two slides to present to our stakeholders.</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p127">
<p>When presenting, we should be clear about the caveats of our analysis; namely, that not all addresses are in a format that allows us to extract the city correctly, at least with the method we have chosen. Another caveat is we have used the government’s list of cities, which excludes larger towns that our stakeholders may be interested in. We would make it clear to our stakeholders that further work is possible to make our city-level figures more accurate. However, we would need to understand the business value of spending more time arriving at a more accurate figure when it might not change the overall result.</p>
</div>
<div class="browsable-container figure-container" id="p128">
<img alt="figure" height="175" src="../Images/2-unnumb-7.png" width="529"/>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p129">
<p><em><span class="aframe-location"/></em>After presenting our results, our stakeholders may want us to continue the analysis and get a more comprehensive answer. What could we do to improve our solution? Perhaps, as we have discussed, we could identify the city or town an address refers to by identifying the postcode. Well, for that, we need a comprehensive list of UK postcodes, the assumption that all values in the “customer address” field contain postcodes, and the assumption that we can find the postcode every time. Another option is to expand our current city list to include towns above a certain population. However, this would not solve the problem where sometimes the name of the city or town is not in the address.</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p130">
<p>Another option is to send these addresses to a third-party geocoding system, such as the Google Maps API, which would find the best match for an address we provide, and the resulting data would contain a field for the town/city that we could use. However, this particular option raises privacy concerns. Do we want to send all our customers’ addresses to a third party? Are we even allowed to do that?</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p131">
<p>Finally, we could augment our data with population statistics or even demographic information about each city or town. This could help us understand whether there are cities where customers are spending less than expected based on their city’s population and are, therefore, being underserved. This was one of our stakeholders’ initial concerns, and this would be one way to address it further.</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p132">
<p>You can start to see how many additional considerations are involved in solving a real business problem. This is why it is vital to arrive at a viable solution as soon as possible so that these additional possibilities are only considered if there is tangible business value in doing so. The value of any further work should be decided in collaboration with key stakeholders.</p>
