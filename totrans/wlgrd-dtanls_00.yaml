    such as ChatGPT and similar large language models. AI tools cannot replace your
    ability to think critically, communicate with stakeholders, or work within the
    constraints of your business environment; however, AI tools can accelerate your
    work by helping you automate the more mechanical aspects of a project. I will
    highlight instances where such a tool could help solve a part of your problem.
    For example, if you don’t know how to read data from a PDF file, an AI model will
    be able to tell you how to access this functionality in your preferred tool and
    give you code snippets to use. This means that you can solve that particular subproblem
    faster, which will make you more productive.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H5
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I use the terms “data science” and “data analysis” interchangeably. First and
    foremost, data scientists need to be good analysts, so I prefer to use the phrase
    “analysis” instead of “data science” to describe the discipline and “analyst”
    instead of “data scientist” when describing the practitioner. When I use “data
    science,” I just mean “the process of analyzing data.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I also refer to the “real world” a lot. The reason for this is to emphasize
    the disconnect between what you learn in a classroom versus what an analyst job
    looks like in practice. This disconnect doesn’t mean classrooms are bad; there
    are simply multiple, not necessarily technical, hurdles to overcome that cannot
    be taught in a classroom. My focus is on preparing junior analysts for their jobs
    by teaching them all the things they couldn’t have learned in their formal training.
    When I say, “real world,” I mean “outside a learning environment.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Similarly, the word “stakeholder” is also a loaded term. I will use it to mean
    your boss, an internal client, or an external customer. They are the originators
    of the requests that generate the work you do. A stakeholder is anyone who is
    the target audience of your analysis and will be directly affected by your work.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: On the job, your success depends far more on the results you deliver than the
    skills and knowledge you bring to a task. Being results oriented means your focus
    is always on problem solving. You should arrive at a first draft solution as soon
    as possible—something I like to call the *minimum viable answer*. This is what
    you present to your stakeholders and what is used as the basis for future iterations.
    Applying this thinking streamlines your work and delivers immediate value. You
    spend time learning something that will be immediately applicable, getting a higher
    return on the time you invest. With this results-focused approach, you do not
    need to be an expert in everything up front; instead, by completing each project,
    you will add new, specific skills to your toolbox and learn a method for approaching
    new tasks efficiently as you go. The results-driven approach I present means practicing
    learning by doing and working in a results-focused way.

    Suppose you work for a car dealership and need to answer the seemingly simple
    question, “How many cars did we sell yesterday?” for your manager. In an ideal
    world, this is a simple business intelligence question that requires nothing more
    than filtering a sales table down to just cars sold yesterday and providing an
    answer. The reality is that we need to think deeper about the problem, starting
    with defining the terms before we begin.

    a question about vehicles came up, we would have to clarify whether that included
    vans or other vehicles that weren’t quite cars. Sometimes vans were relevant,
    sometimes they weren’t. Then, what do we mean by “yesterday”? Often, several dates
    could be associated with a sale event: the day the customer bought an item in
    a store, the day we invoiced a customer for an item, the day the customer paid,
    or even the date a sale-related dispute was resolved. So, when we ask about “yesterday,”
    we need to know which date column to use. Even the word “sell” can be ambiguous.
    What if a customer returns an item later? Does that mean the answer to this question
    changes over time? We might explicitly decide that what happened in the past isn’t
    fixed, which will make our analyses more complicated. Incidentally, we should
    codify answers to these kinds of questions and record them in business-specific
    data models. More on this in chapter 3.'

    a minimum viable answer looks like. This depends on the nature of the request
    and what our stakeholders want to do with the information. If it’s a quick ballpark
    estimate they need, we can sidestep some of those difficult questions about vehicle
    types and dates unless we have a good data model to pull from. Knowing what level
    of answer our stakeholder expects is crucial to deciding how much effort the request
    warrants.

    answer this question?” immediately followed by “Do we have this data?” It is advisable
    to research the available data before committing to any work because there are
    cases where we just don’t have a dataset that directly records the concept we’re
    interested in. For example, in an online auction marketplace, sales transactions
    might not be recorded directly as they could take place outside the system. We
    would need to know where a record is made if a sale is agreed over the phone after
    the auction takes place.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now, we need to obtain the relevant data, either by extracting it from somewhere
    or by creating it. If our online auction marketplace is only used for listing
    and bidding, we might have to make do with inferring when something was sold by
    seeing when it stopped being listed. This is a dataset we would need to create
    from the raw listing data. In this case, we would have to stop at step 3 and regroup
    to figure out whether creating such an inferred sales dataset is worth the effort.
    This will depend on the minimum viable answer we defined in step 2.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    to our minimum viable answer. If the data is only an extract, it should be representative

    and vague. Step 5 might encompass the entirety of other data analysis workflows
    you may have encountered. Steps 1–4 ensure that the doing part will have a higher
    ROI. By this point, you’ve given the problem enough thought that you’re not just
    aimlessly jumping into writing code, which is certainly a temptation when your
    skills are fresh and you’re eager to deliver. I encourage you to spend time on
    steps 1–4, perhaps even more than you instinctively would.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the car example, during this phase, you might find that the sale date of
    a vehicle changes over time based on events such as a customer waiting for a finance
    agreement to come through, or previously undisclosed faults were subsequently
    noticed, and the customer raised a complaint. You as the analyst should not be
    making the decision alone about which possible date constitutes the actual sale
    date. Here, you would go all the way back to step 1 to have a conversation with
    your stakeholders before continuing your analysis.

    is critical for transparency and reproducibility. In the example solutions presented

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    than we might be inclined to. We are looking for a satisfactory solution, so we
    should be discussing preliminary results as early as possible to allow iteration.

    of the business, only to emerge months later with work that no one asked for and

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Finally, you will almost always end up iterating your first answer. It is an
    important step to include in any data analysis framework because it highlights
    the inherent uncertainty of the job. You will never have all the answers up front,
    including an answer to the question “How long will this analysis take?” and that’s
    fine. Accept that a first draft will be necessary to reach a satisfying solution,
    and the sooner that first draft exists, the better. The added benefit of this
    iterative approach is that you become better at estimating how long your work
    will take because you only ever have to estimate one iteration rather than the
    entire project.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Using a results-driven approach, you will develop an intuition for how to make
    analytical decisions that help you focus on providing a pragmatic solution rather
    than an unnecessarily deep answer up front. Of course, you will need to learn
    new tools along the way. Sometimes, these tools will only be used for the analysis
    you have in front of you. The next analysis may need different tools. That’s okay—tools
    come and go, but the knowledge and concepts you learn will remain the same, and
    these are what make a good analyst.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It is important to note that this approach is not a substitute for going deep
    when necessary. I’m not encouraging anyone to learn to take shortcuts. However,
    a key skill in analytics is identifying the highest ROI on your time, which often
    means adopting a breadth-first rather than depth-first approach.
