- en: The evolution of visualization tools in the past decade has transformed the
    process of creating beautiful, informative graphics from something that required
    expensive specialty software and specialized training to something that almost
    anyone can do. As discussed in [Chapter 10](ch10.html#chapter10), however, making
    eloquent visualizations is about more than the tools you have at your disposal;
    it’s about finding the design choices that best enhance and clarify your message.
    While there are many books and courses out there that focus on visualization for
    particular purposes (business or science communication, for example), the following
    list is more of an all-purpose reader—these are great books and resources for
    developing and understanding the history, purpose, and potential of visualization
    and information design if you want to understand this space more broadly.

    is Edward Tufte, who wrote many of the earliest and more influential books on
    the subject. While all of them are beautiful objects, probably the most instructive
    will be the first three: *The Visual Display of Quantitative Information*, *Envisioning
    Information*, and *Visual Explanations* (all from Graphics Press). If you find
    yourself wanting to read his entire opus, he has also published a few shorter
    reports and pamphlets that excerpt his books and offer pointed critiques of, well,
    PowerPoint. All of his publications can purchased on his personal website, [*https://edwardtufte.com*](https://edwardtufte.com),
    but many are also available in public libraries.'

    Lupton](http://elupton.com) (Princeton Architectural Press) is an excellent introduction
    to general graphic design principles that apply anywhere text is involved—which
    is most places, including data-driven visualizations. Lupton’s book introduces
    readers to all the essential aspects of designing with text, providing the vocabulary
    needed to reason about everything from font choice and weight to size, color,
    and spacing. The book is both a great primer and reference, wonderful to have
    on hand if you can buy a copy. If you can’t, a lot of the book’s essentials are
    available for free on the corresponding website, [*http://thinkingwithtype.com*](http://thinkingwithtype.com).

- en: My number-one ready reference for information visualization remains *The Wall
    Street Journal Guide to Information Graphics* (Norton), written by my former colleague,
    Dona Wong. This book has all the tips and tricks you’ll need to accurately and
    beautifully visualize data in one place. Need a pleasing color palette? Check.
    A reminder on how to calculate percent change? Check. Ideas on how to handle negative
    or missing values? Check. A quick read and an invaluable go-to resource; if there’s
    only one book on information visualization that you actually purchase, this should
    be it.

- en: There are hundreds of books and blogs about information visualization, and not
    all of them are created equal—because not all designers are focused on the accurate
    presentation of data. While many folks offer paid workshops in visualization (some
    of which may be quite good), there are also many talented practitioners sharing
    their work and ideas for free.

    resource of visualization critique and redesign. Here you can find more than 15
    years’ worth of Fung’s well-informed perspectives on information design, which
    includes highlighting the data fallacies that sometimes crop up in the visualizations
    of even major news organizations and businesses. A great resource for anyone looking
    to learn about the ways that even well-meaning visualizations can go wrong.

    and elsewhere demonstrates how great data visualizations can also be made by hand
    and reflect the individuality and the humanity of the people that data is about.
