<h1><span class="label">Appendix D. </span>Resources for Visualization and Information Design</h1>&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
<p>The evolution of visualization tools in the past decade has transformed the process of creating beautiful, informative graphics from something that required expensive specialty software and specialized training to something that almost anyone can do. As discussed in <a data-type="xref" href="ch10.html#chapter10">Chapter 10</a>, however, making eloquent visualizations is about more than the tools you have at your disposal; it’s about finding the design choices that best enhance and clarify your message. While there are many books and courses out there that focus on visualization for particular purposes (business or science communication, for example), the following list is more of an all-purpose reader—these are great books and resources for developing and understanding the history, purpose, and potential of visualization and information design if you want to understand this space more broadly.</p>&#13;

<p>Probably <a data-primary="visualizations" data-secondary="resources for information" data-type="indexterm" id="visualization-resources"/><a data-primary="resources for information" data-secondary="on visualizations" data-secondary-sortas="visualizations" data-type="indexterm" id="resources-visualization"/>the most name-checked person in the <a data-primary="Tufte, Edward" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45143392850096"/><a data-primary="The Visual Display of Quantitative Information (Tufte)" data-primary-sortas="Visual Display" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45143392849424"/><a data-primary="Envisioning Information (Tufte)" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45143392848384"/><a data-primary="Visual Explanations (Tufte)" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45143392847744"/>world of information visualization is Edward Tufte, who wrote many of the earliest and more influential books on the subject. While all of them are beautiful objects, probably the most instructive will be the first three: <em>The Visual Display of Quantitative Information</em>, <em>Envisioning Information</em>, and <em>Visual Explanations</em> (all from Graphics Press). If you find yourself wanting to read his entire opus, he has also published a few shorter reports and pamphlets that excerpt his books and offer pointed critiques of, well, PowerPoint. All of his publications can purchased on his personal website, <a href="https://edwardtufte.com"><em class="hyperlink">https://edwardtufte.com</em></a>, but many are also available in public libraries.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Although technically books about <a data-primary="Lupton, Ellen" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45143392843712"/><a data-primary="Thinking With Type (Lupton)" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45143392843008"/>typography, <em>Thinking with Type</em> by <a href="http://elupton.com">Ellen Lupton</a> (Princeton Architectural Press) is an excellent introduction to general graphic design principles that apply anywhere text is involved—which is most places, including data-driven visualizations. Lupton’s book introduces readers to all the essential aspects of designing with text, providing the vocabulary needed to reason about everything from font choice and weight to size, color, and spacing. The book is both a great primer and reference, wonderful to have on hand if you can buy a copy. If you can’t, a lot of the book’s essentials are available for free on the corresponding website, <a href="http://thinkingwithtype.com"><em class="hyperlink">http://thinkingwithtype.com</em></a>.</p>&#13;

This book has all the tips and tricks you’ll need to accurately and beautifully visualize data in one place. Need a pleasing color palette? Check. A reminder on how to calculate percent change? Check. Ideas on how to handle negative or missing values? Check. A quick read and an invaluable go-to resource; if there’s only one book on information visualization that you actually purchase, this should be it.</p>&#13;

<h1>Sources of Inspiration</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p>There are <a data-primary="visualizations" data-secondary="inspiration sources" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45143392833168"/><a data-primary="inspiration for visualizations" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45143392832160"/>hundreds of books and blogs about information visualization, and not all of them are created equal—because not all designers are focused on the accurate presentation of data. While many folks offer paid workshops in visualization (some of which may be quite good), there are also many talented practitioners sharing their work and ideas for free.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Kaiser Fung’s blog <a href="https://junkcharts.typepad.com"><em>Junk Charts</em></a> is a <a data-primary="Fung, Kaiser" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45143392829648"/>long-standing resource of visualization critique and redesign. Here you can find more than 15 years’ worth of Fung’s well-informed perspectives on information design, which includes highlighting the data fallacies that sometimes crop up in the visualizations of even major news organizations and businesses. A great resource for anyone looking to learn about the ways that even well-meaning visualizations can go wrong.</p>&#13;
