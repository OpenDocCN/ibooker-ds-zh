    will involve statistics, coding, and more. Before diving in, I’d like to take
    some time to address my learning objectives for you, how I arrived at this book,
    and what you should expect.

- en: Learning Objective
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: By the end of this book, you should be able to *conduct exploratory data analysis
    and hypothesis testing using a programming language*. Exploring and testing relationships
    is core to analytics. With the tools and frameworks you’ll pick up in this book,
    you will be well positioned to continue learning more advanced data analysis techniques.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We’ll be using Excel, R, and Python because these are powerful tools, and because
    they make for a seamless learning journey. Few books cover this combination, even
    though the progression from spreadsheets into programming is common for analysts,
    myself included.

    along with the majority of the instruction in this book, with some variations,

- en: How I Got Here
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Like many in our field, my route to analytics was circuitous. In school, mathematics
    became a subject I actively avoided; too much of it seemed entirely theoretical.
    I did have some coursework in statistics and econometrics that caught my interest.
    It was a breath of fresh air to *apply* mathematics to some concrete end.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This exposure to statistics was admittedly scant. I attended a liberal arts
    college, where I picked up solid writing and thinking skills, but few quantitative
    ones. When I got to my first full-time job, I was floored by the depth and breadth
    of the data I was entrusted with managing. Much of this data lived in spreadsheets
    and was hard to get much value out of without intense cleaning and preparation.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Some of this “data wrangling” is to be expected; the *New York Times* has reported
    that data scientists spend 50% to 80% of their time [preparing data for analysis](https://oreil.ly/THah7).
    But I wondered if there were more efficient ways to clean, manage, and store data.
    In particular, I wanted to do this so I could spend more time *analyzing* the
    data. After all, I always found statistical analysis somewhat palatable—manual
    and error-prone spreadsheet data preparation, not so much.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Because I enjoyed writing (thank you, liberal arts degree), I started blogging
    about tips I picked up in Excel. Through good grace and hard work, the blog gained
    traction, and I attribute much of my professional success to it. You are welcome
    to stop by at [*stringfestanalytics.com*](https://stringfestanalytics.com); I
    still post regularly on Excel and analytics more generally.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As I began to learn more about Excel, my interest spread to other analytics
    tools and techniques. By this point, the open source programming languages R and
    Python had gained significant popularity in the data world. But while I made my
    way through grasping these languages, I felt unnecessary friction in the learning
    path.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The choice between coding and spreadsheets is often framed like a sort of struggle
    between good and evil. In reality, it’s better to think of these as *complementary*
    tools rather than substitutes. Spreadsheets have their place in analytics; so
    does programming. Learning and using one does not negate the other. [Chapter 5](ch05.html#data-analytics-stack)
    discusses this relationship.

    will use it to bridge the gap between spreadsheets and coding. Unfortunately,
    most instruction instead burns the bridge out of contempt.'

    how to explore and test relationships between variables using Excel. You’ll also
    use Excel to build compelling demonstrations of some of the most important concepts
    in statistics and analytics. This grounding in statistical theory and framework

    up a coding language or two. We’ll start with R, an open source language built
    especially for statistical analysis. You will see how to cleanly transfer what
    you’ve learned about working with data from Excel into R. I conclude the section
    with an end-to-end capstone exercise in R.

    a bland how-to manual rather than a pointed guide for advancing into analytics.
