- en: We all want to make better decisions. Whether it’s to better serve our customers
    or to keep them safe, we want to make the right judgments and do the right thing.
    To act with confidence we need to understand who we are serving and what their
    place is in the world. While there is often an avalanche of data available to
    us, too often it isn’t joined up and doesn’t tell us the full story of the individual
    before us.

- en: Entity resolution is the art and science of connecting the data, joining the
    dots, and seeing the full picture. This book is a practical guide to help you
    reveal that wider context and help you be fully informed before you act. It’s
    often taken for granted, but you’ll see in this book that matching up data isn’t
    always straightforward—but don’t worry, by the final chapter you’ll be well equipped
    to overcome these challenges and bring your datasets to life.

- en: If you are a product manager, a data analyst, or a data scientist within financial
    services, pharmaceuticals, or another large corporation, this book is for you.
    If you are struggling with the challenges of siloed data that doesn’t join up,
    have competing views of your customers in different databases, or are charged
    with merging information from different organizations or affiliates, this book
    is for you.

    reputation and supply chain risks will also benefit from understanding the data
    matching challenges laid out in this book and the techniques to overcome them.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The challenge of entity resolution is all around us—we may not use those words
    but every day this process is repeated time and again. A few weeks before completion
    of this book, my wife asked me to help her check names off a list as she read
    out a list of payers from a bank statement. Had all the people on the list paid?
    This was entity resolution in action!
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The idea for this book was born out of a desire to explain why checking for
    a match against a list of names is not as easy as it sounds, and to showcase some
    of the amazing tools and techniques that are now available to help solve this
    problem at scale.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I hope that by guiding you through some real-life examples you will feel confident
    in  matching up your datasets so that you can serve and protect your customers.
    I’d love to hear about your journey and any feedback on the book itself. Please
    feel free to raise any issues with code that accompanies this book on [GitHub](https://github.com/mshearer0/HandsOnEntityResolution),
    or to discuss entity resolution in general, please contact me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mshearer0).

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Entity resolution is an art, as well as a science. There is no one-size-fits-all
    prescribed solution that will work for every dataset. You will need to make decisions
    about how to tune your process to achieve the results you want. I hope that readers
    of this book will be able to help each other find the optimum solutions and benefit
    from shared experiences.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is intended as a hands-on guide, so I encourage you to follow along
    with the code as you work through each chapter. A key design tenet of the book
    was  to illustrate the challenges and solutions using real-world open source data.
    This brings with it some challenges if you are following along because your results
    may vary slightly as the source dataset is updated from the date of publication.
    Please check the [GitHub page](https://github.com/mshearer0/HandsOnEntityResolution)
    for any recent updates and to access the code that accompanies the book.

    Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow* inspired me to consider writing
    a hands-on guide. I’d also like to express my appreciation to all my former colleagues
    at HSBC who put entity resolution techniques to such good use in combatting financial
    crime.

    Content Acquisitions Editor, for entertaining the initial idea and crafting the
    proposal. Sincerest thanks to Jeff Bleiel for his editorial skill and guiding
    hand throughout the drafting process. Thanks to Aleeya Rahman, Production Editor,
    for her guidance on formatting and the art of LaTeX, and to Kristen Brown, Manager,
    Content Services, for publishing the early releases, which were such an encouraging
    milestone. I’d also like to recognize Karen Montgomery for such a fitting front
    cover illustration—are the birds a match?

    years ago and inspiring me to learn more; to Olivier for his expert guidance on
    the state-of-the-art and his pioneering work on evaluation; and to Robin for his
    commitment to explaining the complexities of entity resolution in a practical,
    accessible way. I’d also like to acknowledge the Splink and OpenMined teams for
    the open source frameworks upon which much of this book is based—“standing on
    the shoulders of giants” comes to mind.
