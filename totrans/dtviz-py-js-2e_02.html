<h1><span class="label">Part I. </span>Basic Toolkit</h1>
<p>This first part of the book provides a basic toolkit for the toolchain to come and is part tutorial, part reference. Given the fairly wide range of knowledge in the target audience, there will probably be things covered that you already know. My advice is just to cherry-pick the material to fill any gaps in your knowledge and maybe skim what you already know as a refresher.</p>
<p>If you’re confident you already have the basic toolkit at hand, feel free to skip to the start of our journey along the toolchain in <a data-type="xref" href="part02.xhtml#part_getting_data">Part II</a>.</p>
