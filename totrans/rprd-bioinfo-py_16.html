<h1><span class="label">Part II. </span>Other Programs</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<div class="partintro">&#13;
<p>In the chapters in this part, I’ll show you several programs I’ve written that capture patterns I have used repeatedly in bioinformatics.&#13;
First, I’ll show you how to write a program to find basic statistics from sequence files and format an output table.&#13;
Next, I’ll demonstrate how to select sequences using pattern matching on the header information followed by a program that will create artificial DNA sequences using data learned from training files.&#13;
Then I’ll show you a program that explores randomness to subsample sequences, and I’ll finish by using Python to parse delimited text files both with and without header information.&#13;
I hope you’ll find patterns in these programs you can use when writing your own.</p>&#13;
