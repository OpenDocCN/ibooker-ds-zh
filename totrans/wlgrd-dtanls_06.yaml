    measures. However, there are statistical tests specifically for categorical data
    or a mix of data types. This is a perfect example of something you might be aware
    of but not have the required specific knowledge until you need it for a project.
    It is, therefore, something with which you can turn to an AI tool. Let’s see what

    unlikely we would see these results in a world where our base, or “null,” hypothesis
    is true. That is to say, in a world where we assume there is no association between
    experience and trust score, how likely are we to calculate the association value
    at which we arrived? The lower this likelihood, the more confident we can be that
    our correlation value is robust. A low p-value means we are inclined to reject
    the null hypothesis, meaning we accept that the association we find, or lack of
    it, is statistically significant.

    suggest there is no link between experience and trust scores. The correlation
    values are negative, which would suggest experienced users distrust AI more, but

    to learn. Do answers to these questions relate to different stances toward AI?

- en: It is worth highlighting that we have just scratched the surface of what information
    is available in the survey data, but our results-driven approach meant we only
    explored avenues that were immediately relevant to the question at hand. That
    is the value of starting with the end result in mind and having something concrete
    to work toward.

    underestimated. Any operational system where data entry consists of multiple-choice
    options or dropdowns, customer surveys with discrete options, or data that contains
    hierarchies such as countries, regions, or departments will generate categorical
    data. Knowing the relevant options to treat this data correctly is crucial, especially
    because, in basic training, there is typically little time devoted to the subject.
    In trying to bridge the gap between training and the real world, understanding
    how to specifically handle categorical data, such as knowing methods like one-hot
    encoding, will go a long way.

    survey data that contains many categorical variables. The specific skills that
    are required for working with categorical data, which can be used for any problem
