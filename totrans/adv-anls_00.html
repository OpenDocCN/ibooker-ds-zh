<h1>Learning Objective</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p>By the end of this book, you <a data-primary="exploratory data analysis (EDA)" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46274543599384"/>should be able to <em>conduct exploratory data analysis and hypothesis testing using a programming language</em>.&#13;
Exploring and testing relationships is core to analytics. With the tools and frameworks you’ll pick up in this book, you will be well positioned to continue learning more advanced data analysis techniques.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>We’ll be using Excel, R, and Python because these are powerful tools, and because they make for a seamless learning journey. Few books cover this combination, even though the progression from spreadsheets into programming is common for analysts, myself included.</p>&#13;

&#13;
<p>I am writing this book on a Windows computer with the <a data-primary="Excel" data-secondary="versions of" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46274548149816"/>Office 365&#13;
version of Excel for desktop. As long as you have a paid version of Excel 2010 or greater for either Windows or Mac installed on your machine, you should be able to follow along with the majority of the instruction in this book, with some variations, particularly with PivotTables and data visualization.</p>&#13;
<div data-type="note" epub:type="note"><h6>Note</h6>&#13;
<p>While Excel offers both free and paid versions online, a paid desktop version is needed to access some of the features covered in this book.</p>&#13;
</div>&#13;
&#13;
<p>R and Python are both free, open source tools available for all major&#13;
operating systems. I address how to install them later in the&#13;

<h2>Technological Requirements</h2>&#13;
&#13;
<p>This book assumes no prior knowledge of R or Python; that said, it does rely on moderate knowledge of Excel to flatten that learning curve.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>The Excel <a data-primary="Excel" data-secondary="background knowledge in" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46274548168072"/>topics you should be familiar with include the following:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<ul>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p>Absolute, relative, and mixed cell references</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p>Conditional logic and conditional aggregation (<code>IF()</code> statements,&#13;
<code>SUMIF()</code>/<code>SUMIFS()</code>, and so forth)</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p>Combining data sources (<code>VLOOKUP()</code>, <code>INDEX()</code>/<code>MATCH()</code>, and so forth)</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p>Sorting, filtering, and aggregating data with PivotTables</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p>Basic plotting (bar charts, line charts, and so forth)</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
&#13;
<p>If you would like more practice with these topics before moving on, I&#13;
suggest <em>Excel&#13;

<h1>How I Got Here</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Like many in our field, my route to analytics was circuitous. In school, mathematics became a subject I actively avoided; too much of it seemed entirely theoretical. I did have some coursework in statistics and econometrics that caught my interest. It was a breath of fresh air to <em>apply</em> mathematics to some concrete end.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>This exposure to statistics was admittedly scant. I attended a liberal arts college, where I picked up solid writing and thinking skills, but few quantitative ones. When I got to my first full-time job, I was floored by the depth and breadth of the data I was entrusted with managing. Much of this data lived in spreadsheets and was hard to get much value out of without intense cleaning and preparation.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Some of <a data-primary="data wrangling" data-seealso="data manipulation" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46274553486504"/>this “data wrangling” is to be expected; the <em>New York Times</em> has reported that data scientists spend 50% to 80% of their time <a href="https://oreil.ly/THah7">preparing data for analysis</a>. But I wondered if there were more <a data-primary="data cleaning" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46274543318424"/><a data-primary="datasets" data-secondary="preparation of" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46274543317752"/>efficient ways to clean, manage, and store data. In particular, I wanted to do this so I could spend more time <em>analyzing</em> the data. After all, I always found statistical analysis somewhat palatable—manual and error-prone spreadsheet data preparation, not so much.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Because I enjoyed writing (thank you, liberal arts degree), I started blogging about tips I picked up in Excel. Through good grace and hard work, the blog gained traction, and I attribute much of my professional success to it. You are welcome to &#13;
<span class="keep-together">stop by</span> at <a class="orm:hideurl" href="https://stringfestanalytics.com"><em>stringfestanalytics.com</em></a>; I still post regularly on Excel and analytics more &#13;
<span class="keep-together">generally</span>.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>As I began to learn more about Excel, my interest spread to other analytics tools and techniques. By this point, the open source programming languages R and Python had gained significant popularity in the data world. But while I made my way through grasping these languages, I felt unnecessary friction in the learning path.</p>&#13;

<h1>“Excel Bad, Coding Good”</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p>I noticed <a data-primary="Excel" data-secondary="and programming languages" data-secondary-sortas="programming languages" data-type="indexterm" id="pre_term1"/>that&#13;
for Excel users, most R or Python&#13;
training sounded a lot like this:</p>&#13;
<blockquote>&#13;
<p>All along, you’ve been using Excel when you really should have been programming. Look at all these problems Excel has caused! Time to kick the habit entirely.</p></blockquote>&#13;
&#13;
<p>That’s the wrong attitude to take for a couple of reasons:</p>&#13;
<dl>&#13;
<dt>It’s not accurate</dt>&#13;
<dd>&#13;
<p>The choice between coding and spreadsheets is often framed like a sort of struggle between good and evil. In reality, it’s better to think of these as <em>complementary</em> tools rather than substitutes. Spreadsheets have their place in analytics; so does programming. Learning and using one does not negate the other. <a data-type="xref" href="ch05.html#data-analytics-stack">Chapter 5</a> discusses this relationship.</p>&#13;
</dd>&#13;
<dt>It’s a poor instructional approach</dt>&#13;
<dd>&#13;
<p>Excel users intuitively understand how to work with data: they can sort, filter, group, and join it. They know which arrangements make for easy analysis, and which mean lots of cleanup. This is a wealth of knowledge to build on. Good instruction will use it to bridge the gap between spreadsheets and coding. Unfortunately, most instruction instead burns the bridge out of contempt.</p>&#13;
</dd>&#13;
</dl>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Research indicates that relating what you’ve learned to what you already know is powerful. As put by Peter C. Brown et al. in <em>Make It Stick: The Science of Successful Learning</em> (Belknap Press):</p>&#13;
<blockquote>&#13;
<p>The more you can explain about the way your new learning relates to your prior knowledge, the stronger your grasp of the new learning will be, and the more connections you create that will help you remember it later.</p></blockquote>&#13;
&#13;
<p>As an Excel user, it can be hard to relate new ideas to what you already know when you’re (wrongly) told that what you already know is garbage. This book takes a &#13;
<span class="keep-together">different</span> approach, building on your prior knowledge of spreadsheets so that you’ll have a clear framework in mind as we move into R and Python.</p>&#13;
<div data-type="note" epub:type="note"><h6>Note</h6>&#13;
<p>Both spreadsheets <em>and</em> programming languages are valuable analytics tools; there’s no need to abandon Excel once you’ve picked up R and Python.</p>&#13;

<h1>The Instructional Benefits of Excel</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p>In fact, <a data-primary="Excel" data-secondary="as teaching tool" data-secondary-sortas="teaching tool" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46274553347480"/>Excel is a uniquely fantastic analytics teaching tool:</p>&#13;
<dl>&#13;
<dt>It reduces cognitive overhead</dt>&#13;
<dd>&#13;
<div class="openblock">&#13;
<p>Cognitive overhead is the number of logical connections or jumps needed to understand something. Often an analytics learning journey looks like this:</p>&#13;
<ol>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p>Learn a brand-new technique.</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p>Learn how to implement the brand-new technique using brand-new&#13;
<em>coding</em> techniques.</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p>Progress to more advanced techniques, without&#13;
ever having felt really comfortable with the basics.</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
&#13;
</ol>&#13;
&#13;
<p>It’s hard enough to learn the conceptual foundations of analytics. To&#13;
learn this while <em>also</em> learning how to code invites sky-high&#13;
cognitive overhead. For reasons I’ll discuss, there is great virtue in practicing analytics via&#13;
coding. But it’s better to isolate these skill sets while mastering&#13;
them.</p>&#13;
</div>&#13;
&#13;
</dd>&#13;
<dt>It’s a visual calculator</dt>&#13;
<dd>&#13;
<div class="openblock">&#13;
<p>The first mass-market <a data-primary="calculators, applications as" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46274543605848"/>offering of a spreadsheet was called&#13;
VisiCalc—literally, a visual&#13;
calculator. This name points to one of the application’s most important selling points. Especially to beginners, programming languages can resemble a “black&#13;
box”—type the magic words, hit “run,” and presto: the results.&#13;
Chances are the program got it right, but it can be hard for a newbie to pop open the hood and see why (or, perhaps more critically, why not).</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>By contrast, Excel lets you watch an analysis take shape each step of&#13;
the way. It lets you calculate and recalculate visually. Rather than just taking my (or a coding language’s) word for it, you’ll build demonstrations in Excel to visualize key &#13;
<span class="keep-together">analytics</span> concepts.</p>&#13;

<div data-type="note" epub:type="note"><h6>Note</h6>&#13;
<p>Excel provides the opportunity to learn the fundamentals of data analytics without&#13;
the need to learn a new programming language at the same time. This&#13;

<h1>Book Overview</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Now that you understand the spirit of the book and what I hope for you to achieve, let’s review its structure.</p>&#13;
<dl>&#13;
<dt><a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="chap-num-title" href="part01.html#part-1">Part I, <em>Foundations of Analytics in Excel</em></a></dt>&#13;
<dd>&#13;
<p>Analytics stands on the shoulders of statistics. In this part, you will learn how to explore and test relationships between variables using Excel. You’ll also use Excel to build compelling demonstrations of some of the most important concepts in statistics and analytics. This grounding in statistical theory and framework for conducting analysis will put you on solid footing for data programming.</p>&#13;
</dd>&#13;
<dt><a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="chap-num-title" href="part02.html#part-2">Part II, <em>From Excel to R</em></a></dt>&#13;
<dd>&#13;
<p>Now that you are fluent in the fundamentals of data analysis, it’s time&#13;
to pick up a coding language or two. We’ll start with R, an open source language built especially for statistical analysis. You will see how to cleanly transfer what you’ve learned about working with data from&#13;
Excel into R. I conclude the section with an end-to-end&#13;
capstone exercise in R.</p>&#13;
</dd>&#13;
<dt><a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="chap-num-title" href="part03.html#part-3">Part III, <em>From Excel to Python</em></a></dt>&#13;
<dd>&#13;
<p>Python is another open source language worth learning for analytics. In the same &#13;
<span class="keep-together">spirit</span> as <a data-type="xref" href="part02.html#part-2">Part II</a>, you’ll learn how to pivot your Excel&#13;
data chops into this language and conduct a complete data analysis.</p>&#13;

<p>When I read books, I tend to skip over the <a data-primary="exercises, end-of-chapter" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46274543519512"/>exercises at the end of the chapter because I&#13;
feel keeping the momentum of my reading is more valuable. <em>Don’t be like me!</em></p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>I provide opportunity at the end of most chapters to practice what you’ve learned. You can find the solutions to these drills in the <a href="https://oreil.ly/KVrIn"><em>exercise-solutions</em> folder</a> of the accompanying repository, where you’ll see them in a file named for each respective chapter. Complete these drills, then compare your answers to the solutions. You’ll be increasing your comprehension of the material while at the same time providing a good example for me.</p>&#13;

<h1>This Is Not a Laundry List</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p>One thing I love about analytics is there are almost always multiple ways to do the same thing. It’s likely I’ll demonstrate how to do something one way when you are familiar with another.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>My focus for this book is on using Excel as a teaching tool for analytics and helping readers transfer this knowledge to R and Python. Were I to make this a brain dump of all the ways to complete a given data-cleaning or analysis task, the book would lose its focus around this particular objective.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>You may prefer alternative ways of doing something; I may even agree with you that, given different circumstances, there is a better approach. However, given the circumstances <em>of this book</em> and its objectives, I’ve decided to cover certain techniques and exclude others. Doing otherwise would risk turning the book into a bland how-to manual rather than a pointed guide for advancing into analytics.</p>&#13;

<h1>Don’t Panic</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p>As an author, I hope you find me easygoing and approachable. I do, however, have one rule for this book: <em>don’t panic!</em> There is an admittedly steep learning curve at play here, since you’ll be exploring not just probability and statistics but <em>two</em> programming languages.&#13;
This book will introduce you to concepts from statistics, computer science, and more. They may initially be jarring, but you’ll begin to internalize them over time. Allow yourself to learn by trial and error.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>I thoroughly believe that with the knowledge you possess about Excel, this is an &#13;
<span class="keep-together">achievable</span> order for one book. There may be moments of frustration and impostor &#13;
<span class="keep-together">syndrome</span>; it happens to all of us. Don’t let these moments overshadow the real progress you’ll make <a data-startref="pre_term1" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46274543594360"/>here.</p>&#13;

<h1>Acknowledgments</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p>First, I want to thank God for giving me this opportunity to cultivate and share my talents. At O’Reilly, Michelle Smith and Jon Hassell have been so enjoyable to work with, and I will be forever grateful for their offer to have me write a book. Corbin Collins kept me rolling during the book’s development. Danny Elfanbaum and the production team turned the raw manuscript into an actual book. Aiden Johnson, Felix Zumstein, and Jordan Goldmeier provided invaluable technical reviews.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Getting people to review a book isn’t easy, so I have to thank John Dennis, Tobias Zwingmann, Joe Balog, Barry Lilly, Nicole LaGuerre, and Alex Bodle for their comments. I also want to thank the communities who have made this technology and knowledge available, often without direct compensation. I’ve made some fantastic friends through my analytics pursuits, who have been so giving of their time and wisdom. My educators at Padua Franciscan High School and Hillsdale College made me fall in love with learning and with writing. I doubt I’d have written a book without their influence.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>I also thank my mother and father for providing me the love and support that I’m so privileged to have. Finally, to my late Papou: thank you for sharing with me the value of hard work and decency.</p>&#13;
