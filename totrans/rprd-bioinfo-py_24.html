<p>The tools we use have a profound (and devious!) influence on our thinking habits, and, therefore, on our thinking abilities.<a data-primary="Dijkstra, Edsger" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45963613497640"/></p>&#13;

<p>This book was inspired by the Rosalind problems, which I’ve spent years revisiting, first as I was trying to understand more about biology and then as I learned new programming languages.&#13;
I initially attempted them with Perl, and since have tried using JavaScript, Haskell, Python, and Rust, with varying degrees of success.&#13;
I would challenge you to also write solutions using any other languages you know.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>I’ve tried to show you patterns in Python you can reuse in your own programs.&#13;
More than anything, I hope I’ve demonstrated that types and tests and various formatting and linting tools can drastically improve the programs you write.</p>&#13;
