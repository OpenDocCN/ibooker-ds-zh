- en: Welcome! If you’ve picked up this book, you’re likely one of the many millions
    of people intrigued by the processes and possibilities surrounding “data”—that
    incredible, elusive new “currency” that’s transforming the way we live, work,
    and even connect with one another. Most of us, for example, are vaguely aware
    of the fact that data—collected by our electronic devices and other activities—is
    being used to shape what advertisements we see, what media is recommended to us,
    and which search results populate first when we look for something online. What
    many people may not appreciate is that the tools and skills for accessing, transforming,
    and generating insight from data are readily available to them. This book aims
    to help those people—you, if you like—do just that.

    number crunchers. Being able to access, understand, and gather insight from data
    is a valuable skill whether you’re a data scientist or a day care worker. The
    tools needed to use data effectively are more accessible than ever before. Not
    only can you do significant data work using only free software and programming
    languages, you don’t even need an expensive computer. All of the exercises in
    this book, for example, were designed and run on a Chromebook that cost less than
    $500\. You can even just use free online platforms through the internet connection
    at your local library.

- en: The goal of this book is to provide the guidance and confidence that data novices
    need to begin exploring the world of data—first by accessing it, then evaluating
    its quality. With those foundations in place, we’ll move on to some of the basic
    methods of analyzing and presenting data to generate meaningful insight. While
    these latter sections will be far from comprehensive (both data analysis and visualization
    are robust fields unto themselves), they will give you the core skills needed
    to generate accurate, informative analyses and visualizations using your newly
    cleaned and acquired data.

- en: This book is intended for true beginners; all you need are a basic understanding
    of how to use computers (e.g., how to download a file, open a program, copy and
    paste, etc.), an open mind, and a willingness to experiment. I especially encourage
    you to take a chance on this book if you are someone who feels intimidated by
    data or programming, if you’re “bad at math,” or imagine that working with data
    or learning to program is too hard for you. I have spent nearly a decade teaching
    hundreds of people who didn’t think of themselves as “technical” the exact skills
    contained in this book, and I have never once had a student who was genuinely
    unable to get through this material. In my experience, the most challenging part
    of programming and working with data is not the difficulty of the material but
    the quality of the instruction.^([1](preface01.html#idm45143428969872)) I am grateful
    both to the many students over the years whose questions have helped me immeasurably
    in finding ways to convey this material better, and for the opportunity to share
    what I learned from them with so many others through this book. While a book cannot
    truly replace the kind of support provided by a human teacher, I hope it will
    at least give the tools you need to master the basics—and perhaps the inspiration
    to take those skills to the next level.

    of spreadsheet tools or want to expand the range of data formats they can easily
    access and manipulate will also find this book useful, as will those with frontend
    programming skills (in JavaScript or PHP, for example) who are looking for a way
    to get started with Python.

- en: As noted previously, this book is intended for beginners. So while you may find
    some sections useful if you are new to data analysis or visualization, this volume
    is not designed to serve those with prior experience in Python or another data-focused
    programming language (like R). Fortunately, O’Reilly has many specialized volumes
    that deal with advanced Python topics and libraries, such as Wes McKinney’s [*Python
    for Data Analysis*](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/python-for-data/9781491957653/)
    (O’Reilly) or the [*Python Data Science Handbook*](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/python-data-science/9781491912126/)
    by Jake VanderPlas (O’Reilly).

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'The content of this book is designed to be followed in the order presented,
    as the concepts and exercises in each chapter build on those explored previously.
    Throughout, however, you will find that exercises are presented in two ways: as
    code “notebooks” and as “standalone” programming files. The purpose of this is
    twofold. First, it allows you, the reader, to use whichever approach you prefer
    or find more accessible; second, it provides a way to compare these two methods
    of interacting with data-driven Python code. In my experience, Python “notebooks”
    are extremely useful for getting up and running quickly but can become tedious
    if you develop a reliable piece of code that you wish to run repeatedly. Since
    the code from one format often cannot simply be copied and pasted to the other,
    both are provided in the accompanying GitHub repo. Data files, too, are available
    via Google Drive. As you follow along with the exercises, you will be able to
    use the format you prefer and will also have the option of seeing the differences
    in the code for each format firsthand.'

- en: Although Python is the primary tool used in this book, effective data wrangling
    and analysis are made easier through the smart use of a range of tools, from text
    editors (the programs in which you will actually write your code) to spreadsheet
    programs. Because of this, there are occasional exercises in this book that rely
    on other free and/or open source tools besides Python. Wherever these are introduced,
    I will offer some context as to why that tool has been chosen, along with sufficient
    instructions to complete the example task.

    years who were brave enough to try something new and ask sincere questions along
    the way. The process of writing this book (to say nothing of the text itself)
    was made immeasurably better by my editor, Jeff Bleiel, whose pleasantness, flexibility,
    and light touch tempered my excesses while making space for my personal style.
    I am also grateful for the thoughtful and generous comments of my reviewers: Joanna
    S. Kao, Anne Bonner, and Randy Au.'
