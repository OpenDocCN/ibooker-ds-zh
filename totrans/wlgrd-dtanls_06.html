<p>Most participants have less than 10 years of experience, with a long tail out toward 50. Now, if we were to test the relationship between this continuous value and another, we could simply calculate the correlation. However, we are trying to compare this against categorical data, such as how favorably someone views AI, so correlation in the traditional sense does not apply. One idea is to separate out this histogram of experience or similar visualizations of distribution, such as box plots, by the different answers to the favorability question. Let us look at an example using something the Python library <code>seaborn</code> calls “boxenplots,” which are similar to box-and-whisker plots but with more information. The following code results in the plot in figure 7.4:</p>

<div class="readable-text" id="p45">
<p>This plot tells us that the highest median years of experience is in the unfavorable group. That is, the ones who view AI tools unfavorably are, on average, the more experienced coders. However, this median value is not a lot higher than for other groups, and each group has a lot of variance. Let’s now look at how much different experience levels trust the output of AI tools.

<p>Again, those who gave the more negative answers tend to have more experience on average. The difference is possibly higher than with favorability and also suggests that more experienced coders are less likely to trust the output of such tools. What we really want to know is the opposite question: rather than what is the distribution of experience across different answers, we want to know, what is the distribution of different answers across experience levels?</p>

<div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p49">

Bins can be created manually, like in the following example, but can also be based on the data. One such method would be using quantiles, which would ensure each bin has the same amount of data. The following code bins our data and verifies the minimum and maximum years of experience within each bin, using the output shown in figure 7.6:</p>

<div class="readable-text" id="p68">
<p>Most statistical tests covered in data education are designed for continuous measures. However, there are statistical tests specifically for categorical data or a mix of data types. This is a perfect example of something you might be aware of but not have the required specific knowledge until you need it for a project. It is, therefore, something with which you can turn to an AI tool. Let’s see what ChatGPT says when asked the question, “What methods can I use to measure the association between a continuous and an ordinal variable?”</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p69">
<p>It gives multiple approaches, including visualizations that we have already performed. It summarizes its recommendations with “If you’re interested in the overall strength and direction of the relationship, Spearman’s rank correlation or Kendall’s Tau can be useful.” These sound like good places to start.</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p70">
<p>Both of these methods are rank based, meaning they do not use the ordinal values directly but use their rank among all answers. This might<span class="aframe-location"/> again be something you haven’t done with your specific tool before, and an AI tool could give you a relevant code snippet. Figure 7.11 shows ChatGPT’s answer when prompted to give sample code to calculate Spearman’s rank correlation with Python.</p>

<p>Obviously, this code snippet isn’t directly useable, but it requires just a few modifications. Let’s apply ChatGPT’s code to our own and calculate Spearman’s rank correlation, as well as Kendall’s Tau value, which can be done in a similar manner. Two minor points to make here are that we have to drop any missing data for this analysis and ignore cases where no answer was given to the trust question since that value doesn’t fit into the ordinal nature of the answers. First, we will create the ranking, and then calculate the two statistical metrics. The output, the final printout, is shown in figure 7.12:</p>

<p>In both tests, a correlation value close to zero means the association between variables is weak. The second value in both printouts is the p-value, a proxy for the significance of the result. A value close to zero means it is extremely unlikely we would see these results in a world where our base, or “null,” hypothesis is true. That is to say, in a world where we assume there is no association between experience and trust score, how likely are we to calculate the association value at which we arrived? The lower this likelihood, the more confident we can be that our correlation value is robust. A low p-value means we are inclined to reject the null hypothesis, meaning we accept that the association we find, or lack of it, is statistically significant.</p>

<div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p76">
<p>In this case, the statistical tests tell us there is significant evidence to suggest there is no link between experience and trust scores.

<p>Previous findings, such as the heatmap in figure 6.45 in the previous chapter, showed that very few people are using AI for collaboration, and figure 7.14 reinforces this. Participants explicitly said they don’t imagine using AI tools for collaboration with humans, and around a quarter also aren’t interested in using them for project planning or deployment and monitoring. It seems there are specific tasks that people do not want to delegate to AI tools. Finally, let’s do our long-form data transformation to arrive at a heatmap to break this last analysis down by job role. This final heatmap is shown in figure 7.15:</p>

<p>Rather than summarize all our findings, let’s focus on the ones directly related to our initial questions. Our stakeholders’ initial hypotheses were that</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li class="readable-text" id="p99"> New and experienced coders are using these tools differently. </li>
<li class="readable-text" id="p100"> People’s opinions on the usefulness and trustworthiness of current AI tools depend on their experience, job role, and what specifically they use the tools for. </li>
</ul>
<div class="readable-text" id="p101">
<p>To answer these points, in our analysis, we found that</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li class="readable-text" id="p102"> Writing and debugging code are the most popular AI use cases, but there is undeniable variation in what different job roles currently use AI tools for. </li>
<li class="readable-text" id="p103"> There are clearly use cases for AI that people are less interested in. </li>
<li class="readable-text" id="p104"> Existing users of AI tools seem to favor and trust these tools more than aspiring users. </li>
<li class="readable-text" id="p105"> There is little evidence that a developer’s years of experience affects trust in AI tools. </li>
</ul>
<div class="readable-text" id="p106">
<p>What can we recommend in terms of market gaps to exploit? We have seen that those who actively use AI tools are more likely to view them more positively than potential users, so marketing the benefits of these tools is crucial. The market will already be saturated with AI-driven coding tools, so we should focus on the popular but less well-served use cases. Examples of this would include learning about a codebase, documenting existing code, and testing. We have also seen which gaps don’t exist; it does not seem sensible to pursue AI-driven collaboration or project management tools.</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p107">
<p>These findings are more than enough for an initial stakeholder review, but there are plenty of avenues in the data to explore the viability of an AI-driven discovery/documentation tool further, such as</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li class="readable-text" id="p108"> There is a question about how often someone can find information within their business. We could cross-reference people who answered “often” with the current and future use cases to gauge interest in such a tool. </li>
<li class="readable-text" id="p109"> There is also a question about how long people spend searching for information. Again, this could be cross-referenced with answers about AI tools and use cases. </li>
<li class="readable-text" id="p110"> Finally, there is a question about how often people need help from their team, which again could be explored as a way to get people interested in AI assistance. </li>
</ul>
<div class="readable-text" id="p111">
<p>During our analysis, we also encountered some limitations in our data worth communicating to our stakeholders. The data is heavily biased toward developers, specifically those active on Stack Overflow. Even the README file for the dataset notes that “highly engaged users on Stack Overflow were more likely to notice the links for the survey and click to begin it.” This is not necessarily a bad case of selection bias since the target audience of our startup overlaps with engaged Stack Overflow users. We are missing the presence of developers who aren’t active online, and it would be worth quantifying this population and investigating other means of capturing their pain points and opinions.</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p112">
<p>We also do not have access to some of the free text answers, which would have given us deeper insight into how people are using and want to use AI tools. Creating our own qualitative survey or interviews could help us get a better understanding of our target market but would incur significant costs compared to using an existing survey.</p>

</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p114">
<p>The survey data used in this chapter has more dimensions that can be explored. As with all projects, I recommend taking the time to consider different research questions that could be answered. Here are some ideas to get you started:</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li class="readable-text" id="p115"> Is there a relationship between the tools that developers use and their opinions and usage of AI? There are survey questions about programming languages and other related tools that we did not explicitly explore in the project. </li>
<li class="readable-text" id="p116"> There is a question about the industry the developer currently works in, which opens up opportunities to compare results across industries. Are some industries more forward-thinking with regard to AI than others? </li>
<li class="readable-text" id="p117"> At the start of the survey, there are questions about how developers prefer to learn. Do answers to these questions relate to different stances toward AI? </li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p118">
<p>It is worth highlighting that we have just scratched the surface of what information is available in the survey data, but our results-driven approach meant we only explored avenues that were immediately relevant to the question at hand. That is the value of starting with the end result in mind and having something concrete to work toward.</p>

</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p120">
<p>The prevalence of categorical data in real business scenarios should not be underestimated. Any operational system where data entry consists of multiple-choice options or dropdowns, customer surveys with discrete options, or data that contains hierarchies such as countries, regions, or departments will generate categorical data. Knowing the relevant options to treat this data correctly is crucial, especially because, in basic training, there is typically little time devoted to the subject. In trying to bridge the gap between training and the real world, understanding how to specifically handle categorical data, such as knowing methods like one-hot encoding, will go a long way.</p>
