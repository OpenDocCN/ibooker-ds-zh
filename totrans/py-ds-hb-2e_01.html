<h1><span class="label">Part I. </span>Jupyter: Beyond Normal Python</h1>
<p><a data-primary="Jupyter notebook" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45858813461568"/>There are many options for development environments for Python, and
I’m often asked which one I use in my own work. My answer
sometimes surprises people: my preferred environment is
<a href="http://ipython.org">IPython</a> plus a text editor (in my case, Emacs or
VSCode depending on my mood). Jupyter got its start as the IPython
shell, which was created in 2001 by Fernando Perez as an enhanced Python
interpreter and has since grown into a project aiming to provide, in
Perez’s words<a data-primary="Perez, Fernando" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45858814496096"/>, “Tools for the entire life cycle of research
computing.” If Python is the engine of our data science task, you might
think of Jupyter as the interactive control panel.</p>
<p>As well as being a useful interactive interface to Python, Jupyter also
provides a number of useful syntactic additions to the language;
we’ll cover the most useful of these additions here. Perhaps
the most familiar interface provided by the Jupyter project is the
Jupyter Notebook, a browser-based environment that is useful for
development, collaboration, sharing, and even publication of data
science results. As an example of the usefulness of the notebook format,
look no further than the page you are reading: the entire manuscript for
this book was composed as a set of Jupyter notebooks.</p>
<p>This part of the book will start by stepping through some of the Jupyter
and IPython features that are useful to the practice of data science,
focusing especially on the syntax they offer beyond the standard
features of Python. Next, we will go into a bit more depth on some of
the more useful <em>magic commands</em> that can speed up common tasks in
creating and using data science code. Finally, we will touch on some of
the features of the notebook that make it useful for understanding data
and sharing results.</p>
