<h1>Preface</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Data<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="data science, state of the field" data-type="indexterm" id="ix_data_sci_field"/> science is exciting work. The ability to draw insights from messy data is valuable for all kinds of decision making across business, medicine, policy, and more. This book, <em>Learning Data Science</em>, aims to prepare readers to do data science. To achieve this, we’ve designed this book with the following special features:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<dl class="simple myst">&#13;
	<dt>Focus on the fundamentals</dt>&#13;
	<dd>&#13;
	<p>Technologies come and go. While we work with specific technologies in this book, our goal is to equip readers with the fundamental building blocks of data science. We do this by revealing how to think about data science problems and challenges, and by covering the fundamentals behind the individual technologies. Our aim is to serve readers even as technologies change.</p>&#13;
	</dd>&#13;
	<dt>Cover the entire data science lifecycle</dt>&#13;
	<dd>&#13;
	<p>Instead of just focusing on a single topic, like how to work with data tables or how to apply machine learning techniques, we cover the entire data science lifecycle—the process of asking a question, obtaining data, understanding the data, and understanding the world. Working through the entire lifecycle can often be the hardest part of being a data scientist.</p>&#13;
	</dd>&#13;
	<dt>Use real data</dt>&#13;
	<dd>&#13;
	<p>To be prepared for working on real problems, we consider it essential to learn from examples that use real data, with their warts and all. We chose the datasets presented in this book by carefully picking from actual data analyses that have made an impact, rather than using overly refined or synthetic data.</p>&#13;
	</dd>&#13;
	<dt>Apply concepts through case studies</dt>&#13;
	<dd>&#13;
	<p>We’ve included extended case studies throughout the book that follow or extend analyses from other data scientists. These case studies show readers how to navigate the data science lifecycle in real settings.</p>&#13;
	</dd>&#13;
	<dt>Combine both computational and inferential thinking</dt>&#13;
	<dd>&#13;
	<p>On the job, data scientists need to foresee how the decisions they make when writing code and how the size of a dataset might affect statistical analysis. To prepare readers for their future work, <em>Learning Data Science</em> integrates computational and statistical thinking. We also motivate statistical concepts through simulation studies rather than mathematical proofs.</p>&#13;

<h1>Expected Background Knowledge</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p>We expect<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Python" data-seealso="pandas library; specific tools" data-type="indexterm" id="id598"/> readers to be proficient in Python and understand how to use built-in data structures like lists, dictionaries, and sets; import and use functions and classes from other packages; and write functions from scratch. We also use the <code>numpy</code> Python package without introduction but don’t expect readers to have much prior experience using it.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Readers will get more from this book if they also know a bit of probability, calculus, and linear algebra, but we aim to explain mathematical ideas intuitively.</p>&#13;

<h1>Organization of the Book</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p>This book has 21 chapters, divided into six parts:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<dl class="simple myst">&#13;
	<dt><a data-type="xref" href="part01.html#part-1">Part I</a> (Chapters <a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="select:labelnumber" href="ch01.html#ch-lifecycle">1</a>–<a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="select:labelnumber" href="ch05.html#ch-bus">5</a>)</dt>&#13;
	<dd>&#13;
	<p><a data-type="xref" href="part01.html#part-1">Part I</a> describes what the lifecycle is, makes one full pass through the lifecycle at a basic level, and introduces terminology that we use throughout the book. The part concludes with a short case study about bus arrival times.</p>&#13;
	</dd>&#13;

	</dd>&#13;
	<dt><a data-type="xref" href="part04.html#part-4">Part IV</a> (Chapters <a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="select:labelnumber" href="ch13.html#ch-text">13</a>–<a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="select:labelnumber" href="ch14.html#ch-web">14</a>)</dt>&#13;
	<dd>&#13;
	<p><a data-type="xref" href="part04.html#part-4">Part IV</a> looks at widely used alternative sources of data, like text, binary, and data from the web.</p>&#13;

It covers inferential topics like confidence intervals and hypothesis testing in addition to model fitting, <span class="keep-together">feature</span> engineering, and model selection. This part ends with a case study about predicting donkey weights for veterinarians in Kenya.</p>&#13;
	</dd>&#13;
	<dt><a data-type="xref" href="part06.html#part-6">Part VI</a> (Chapters <a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="select:labelnumber" href="ch19.html#ch-logistic">19</a>–<a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="select:labelnumber" href="ch21.html#ch-fake-news">21</a>)</dt>&#13;
	<dd>&#13;
	<p><a data-type="xref" href="part06.html#part-6">Part VI</a> completes our study of supervised learning with logistic regression and optimization. It ends with a case study on predicting whether news articles make real or fake statements.</p>&#13;

<h1>Acknowledgments</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p>This book has come about from our joint experience designing and teaching “Principles and Techniques of Data Science,” an undergraduate course at the University of California, Berkeley. We first taught “Data 100” in spring 2017 in response to student demand for a second course in data science; they wanted a course that would prepare them for advanced study in data science and for the workforce.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>The thousands of students we have taught since that first offering have been an inspiration for us. We’ve also benefited from co-teaching with other instructors, including Ani Adhikari, Andrew Bray, John DeNero, Sandrine Dudoit, Will Fithian, Joe Hellerstein, Josh Hug, Anthony Joseph, Scott Lee, Fernando Perez, Alvin Wan, Lisa Yan, and Bin Yu. We especially thank Joe Hellerstein for insights around data wrangling, Fernando Perez for encouraging us to include more complex data structures like NetCDF, Josh Hug for the idea of the PurpleAir case study, and Duncan Temple Lang for collaboration on an earlier version of the course. We also thank the Berkeley students who have been our teaching assistants, and especially mention those who have contributed to previous versions of the book: Ananth Agarwal, Ashley Chien, Andrew Do, Tiffany Jann, Sona Jeswani, Andrew Kim, Jun Seo Park, Allen Shen, Katherine Yen, and Daniel Zhu.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>A core part of this book is the many datasets that we wrangle and analyze, and we are immensely thankful to the individuals and organizations that made their data open and available to us. At the end of this book, we list these contributors along with the original data sources, and related research papers, blog posts, and reports.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Lastly, we are grateful to the O’Reilly team for their work to bring this book from class notes to publication, especially Melissa Potter, Jess Haberman, Aaron Black, Danny Elfanbaum, and Mike Loukides. We’d also like to thank the technical reviewers whose comments have improved the book: Sona Jeswani, Thomas Nield, Siddharth Yadav, and Abhijit Dasgupta.</p>&#13;
