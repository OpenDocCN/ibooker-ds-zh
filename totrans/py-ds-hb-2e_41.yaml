- en: 'This final part is an introduction to the very broad topic of machine learning,
    mainly via Python’s [Scikit-Learn package](http://scikit-learn.org). You can think
    of machine learning as a class of algorithms that allow a program to detect particular
    patterns in a dataset, and thus “learn” from the data to draw inferences from
    it. This is not meant to be a comprehensive introduction to the field of machine
    learning; that is a large subject and necessitates a more technical approach than
    we take here. Nor is it meant to be a comprehensive manual for the use of the
    Scikit-Learn package (for this, you can refer to the resources listed in [“Further
    Machine Learning Resources”](ch50.xhtml#section-0515-learning-more)). Rather,
    the goals here are:'

    I have given on several occasions at PyCon, SciPy, PyData, and other conferences.
    Any clarity in the following pages is likely due to the many workshop participants
    and co-instructors who have given me valuable feedback on this material over the
    years!
