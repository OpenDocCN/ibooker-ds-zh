<h1>Preface</h1>&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
<p>Welcome! If you’ve picked up this book, you’re likely one of the many millions of people intrigued by the processes and possibilities surrounding “data”—that incredible, elusive new “currency” that’s transforming the way we live, work, and even &#13;
<span class="keep-together">connect</span> with one another. Most of us, for example, are vaguely aware of the fact that data—collected by our electronic devices and other activities—is being used to shape what advertisements we see, what media is recommended to us, and which search results populate first when we look for something online. What many people may not appreciate is that the tools and skills for accessing, transforming, and generating insight from data are readily available to them. This book aims to help those people—you, if you like—do just that.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Data is not something that is only available or useful to big companies or governmental number crunchers. Being able to access, understand, and gather insight from data is a valuable skill whether you’re a data scientist or a day care worker. The tools needed to use data effectively are more accessible than ever before. Not only can you do significant data work using only free software and programming languages, you don’t even need an expensive computer. All of the exercises in this book, for example, were designed and run on a Chromebook that cost less than $500. You can even just use free online platforms through the internet connection at your local library.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>The goal of this book is to provide the guidance and confidence that data novices need to begin exploring the world of data—first by accessing it, then evaluating its quality. With those foundations in place, we’ll move on to some of the basic methods of analyzing and presenting data to generate meaningful insight. While these latter sections will be far from comprehensive (both data analysis and visualization are robust fields unto themselves), they will give you the core skills needed to generate accurate, informative analyses and visualizations using your newly cleaned and acquired data.</p>&#13;

<h1>Who Should Read This Book?</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p>This book is intended for true beginners; all you need are a basic understanding of how to use computers (e.g., how to download a file, open a program, copy and paste, etc.), an open mind, and a willingness to experiment. I especially encourage you to take a chance on this book if you are someone who feels intimidated by data or programming, if you’re “bad at math,” or imagine that working with data or learning to program is too hard for you. I have spent nearly a decade teaching hundreds of people who didn’t think of themselves as “technical” the exact skills contained in this book, and I have never once had a student who was genuinely unable to get through this material. In my experience, the most challenging part of programming and working with data is not the difficulty of the material but the quality of the instruction.<sup><a data-type="noteref" href="preface01.html#idm45143428969872" id="idm45143428969872-marker">1</a></sup> I am grateful both to the many students over the years whose questions have helped me immeasurably in finding ways to convey this material better, and for the opportunity to share what I learned from them with so many others through this book. While a book cannot truly replace the kind of support provided by a human teacher, I hope it will at least give the tools you need to master the basics—and perhaps the inspiration to take those skills to the next level.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Folks who have some experience with data wrangling but have reached the limits of spreadsheet tools or want to expand the range of data formats they can easily access and manipulate will also find this book useful, as will those with frontend programming skills (in JavaScript or PHP, for example) who are looking for a way to get started with Python.</p>&#13;

<h5>Where Would You like to Go?</h5>&#13;
<p>In the preface to media theorist Douglas Rushkoff’s book <em>Program or Be Programmed</em> (OR Books), he compares the act of programming to that of driving a car. Unless you learn to program, Rushkoff writes, you are a perpetual passenger in the digital world, one who “is getting driven from place to place. Only the car has no windows and if the driver tells you there is only one supermarket in the county, you have to believe him.”</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>“You can relegate your programming to others,” Rushkoff continues, “but then you have to trust them that their programs are really doing what you’re asking, and in a way that is in your best interests.” More and more these days, the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/sep/14/facebook-aware-instagram-harmful-effect-teenage-girls-leak-reveals">latter assertion is being thrown into question</a>.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Over the years, I’ve asked several hundred students if they believe anyone can learn to drive, and the answer has always been yes. At the same time, I have met few people, apart from myself, who truly believe that <em>anyone</em> can program. Yet driving a motor vehicle is, in reality, vastly more complex than programming a computer. Why, then, do so many of us imagine that programming will be “too hard” for us?</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>For me, this is where the real strength of Rushkoff’s analogy shows, because his “windowless car” doesn’t just hide the outside world from the passenger—it also hides the “driver” from passersby. It’s easy to believe that anyone can drive a car because we actually <em>see</em> all kinds of people driving cars, every day.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>When it comes to programming, though, we rarely get to see who is “behind the wheel,” which means our ideas about who <em>can</em> and <em>should</em> program are largely defined <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2014/10/21/357629765/when-women-stopped-coding">by media that portray programmers as typically white and overwhelmingly male</a>. As a result, those characteristics have come to dominate who <em>does</em> program—but there’s no reason why it should. Because if you can drive a car—or even punctuate a sentence—I promise you can program a computer, too.</p>&#13;

<h1>Who Shouldn’t Read This Book?</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p>As noted previously, this book is intended for beginners. So while you may find some sections useful if you are new to data analysis or visualization, this volume is not designed to serve those with prior experience in Python or another data-focused programming language (like R). Fortunately, O’Reilly has many specialized volumes that deal with advanced Python topics and libraries, such as Wes McKinney’s <a class="orm:hideurl" href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/python-for-data/9781491957653/"><em>Python for Data Analysis</em></a> (O’Reilly) or the <a class="orm:hideurl" href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/python-data-science/9781491912126/"><em>Python Data Science Handbook</em></a> by Jake VanderPlas (O’Reilly).</p>&#13;

<h1>What to Expect from This Volume</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p>The content of this book is designed to be followed in the order presented, as the concepts and exercises in each chapter build on those explored previously. Throughout, however, you will find that exercises are presented in two ways: as code “notebooks” and as “standalone” programming files. The purpose of this is twofold. First, it allows you, the reader, to use whichever approach you prefer or find more accessible; second, it provides a way to compare these two methods of interacting with data-driven Python code. In my experience, Python “notebooks” are extremely useful for getting up and running quickly but can become tedious if you develop a reliable piece of code that you wish to run repeatedly. Since the code from one format often cannot simply be copied and pasted to the other, both are provided in the accompanying GitHub repo. Data files, too, are available via Google Drive. As you follow along with the exercises, you will be able to use the format you prefer and will also have the option of seeing the differences in the code for each format firsthand.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Although Python is the primary tool used in this book, effective data wrangling and analysis are made easier through the smart use of a range of tools, from text editors (the programs in which you will actually write your code) to spreadsheet programs. Because of this, there are occasional exercises in this book that rely on other free and/or open source tools besides Python. Wherever these are introduced, I will offer some context as to why that tool has been chosen, along with sufficient instructions to complete the example task.</p>&#13;

<h1>Acknowledgments</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p>As I mentioned previously, this book owes much to my many students over the years who were brave enough to try something new and ask sincere questions along the way. The process of writing this book (to say nothing of the text itself) was made immeasurably better by my editor, Jeff Bleiel, whose pleasantness, flexibility, and light touch tempered my excesses while making space for my personal style. I am also grateful for the thoughtful and generous comments of my reviewers: Joanna S. Kao, Anne Bonner, and Randy Au.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>I would also like to thank Jess Haberman, who offered me the chance to make this material my own, as well as Jacqueline Kazil and Katharine Jarmul, who helped put me in her way. I’d also like to thank Jeannette Wing and Cliff Stein and the staff at Columbia University’s Data Science Institute, whose interest in this work has already helped it generate exciting new opportunities. And of course, I want to thank my friends and relations for their interest and support, even—and especially—when they had no idea what I was talking about.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Finally, I’d want to thank my family (including the children too young to read this) for staying supportive even when the Sad SpongeBob days set in. You make the work worth doing.</p>&#13;
