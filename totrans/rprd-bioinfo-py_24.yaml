- en: This book was inspired by the Rosalind problems, which I’ve spent years revisiting,
    first as I was trying to understand more about biology and then as I learned new
    programming languages. I initially attempted them with Perl, and since have tried
    using JavaScript, Haskell, Python, and Rust, with varying degrees of success.
    I would challenge you to also write solutions using any other languages you know.

    More than anything, I hope I’ve demonstrated that types and tests and various
    formatting and linting tools can drastically improve the programs you write.
