  </div>
  <div class="readable-text  intended-text" id="p13"> 
   <p>Eager to dive in? Then let's get started with the basics.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text" id="p14"> 
   <h2 class=" readable-text-h2">1.1 Building web apps</h2>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text " id="p15"> 
   <p>Before we get to Streamlit itself, let's talk about web apps and why you would want to build one, which is what Streamlit is for.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text  intended-text" id="p16"> 
   <p>A <em>graphical app</em> is an application with a <em>graphical user interface (GUI)</em> that you can interact with by clicking a mouse or touching on-screen controls. Contrast this with a <em>command-line app</em>, which has a<em> command-line user interface </em>where you type text inputs into a terminal and get the results back in the same terminal. You've likely written a few of the latter using Python.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text  intended-text" id="p17"> 
   <p>A <em>web application (</em>or<em> web app)</em> is a graphical app that you access through a web browser, such as when you access Gmail or Netflix using the Google Chrome browser, as opposed to a <em>desktop app</em>, which is a program that runs directly on your computer (e.g., Photoshop or Notepad running on your PC), or a <em>native mobile app, </em>which runs directly on your mobile phone (e.g., Uber or when you access Gmail through the iPhone Gmail app).</p>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text  intended-text" id="p18"> 
   <p>Streamlit helps you build web apps, not command-line, desktop or native mobile apps. But why would you want to do that?</p>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text" id="p19"> 
   <h3 class=" readable-text-h3">1.1.1 Why build a graphical app in the first place?</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text " id="p20"> 
   <p>If you've learned Python, chances are that you're comfortable with creating command-line programs. These are the easiest types of apps to create, and Python provides native support for them.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text  intended-text" id="p21"> 
   <p>The trouble is, outside of techies, no one likes to use command-line programs for anything significant. Graphical apps are much less intimidating and give users a more intuitive experience.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text  intended-text" id="p22"> 
   <p>This is true generally, but also in the workplace. If you want to automate something at work for a non-technical audience and expect people to actually use what you've built, you'll need to make a graphical interface to go with it. You might have created the perfect solution to a genuine problem that cuts the effort required to accomplish something from hours to minutes, but the minute you tell people they're going to have to open up a terminal and type commands into it, you'll have lost them.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text" id="p23"> 
   <h3 class=" readable-text-h3">1.1.2 Why build apps for the web?</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text " id="p24"> 
   <p>Graphical apps provide a clear usability advantage, but why build a web app rather than a desktop app or a native mobile app?</p>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text  intended-text" id="p25"> 
   <p>Over the past two decades, web apps have become increasingly popular for a whole host of reasons. Here are just a couple:</p>
  </div>
  <ul> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p26">Web apps can run on pretty much any device that has a web browser. This means you can code your app once and have users be able to run your program on their computer, tablet or phone with no extra effort.</li>
   <li class="readable-text" id="p27">Users don't have to install or update web apps manually; by visiting the right web address, they are always using the latest version.</li>
  </ul>
  <div class="readable-text " id="p28"> 
   <p>Web apps are especially popular within companies. Most companies today have an <em>intranet</em>, which is an internal network of web pages only open to their employees. Since all employees are used to accessing the intranet, it often makes a lot of sense for a company to host their internal programs on this intranet as web apps rather than have people go through the trouble of installing desktop or mobile apps.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text  intended-text" id="p29"> 
   <p>Of course, there are certainly valid reasons to build desktop or mobile apps instead, such as when performance or offline access is critical. However, for many use cases, the benefits of web apps make them the preferred choice for both developers and users.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text" id="p30"> 
   <h3 class=" readable-text-h3">1.1.3 What do you need to build a web app?</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text " id="p31"> 
   <p>Hopefully you've bought into the idea of creating web apps enough to turn to the next question: how?</p>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text  intended-text" id="p32"> 
   <p>Generally speaking (and simplifying somewhat), a web app has two big parts: a <em>frontend</em> and a <em>backend</em>. The frontend contains the onscreen things that people interact with, such as buttons, textboxes, menus, and what have you. The backend has the actual logic that fulfills the app's purpose, such as crunching numbers or looking something up in a database.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text  intended-text" id="p33"> 
   <p>The skills and languages required to create the backend are quite different from those required for the frontend. You can write your backend logic in Python (which this book assumes you're familiar with), primarily focusing on getting your business logic to work.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text  intended-text" id="p34"> 
   <p>Writing the frontend, on the other hand, involves focusing on the user experience where there are fewer "right" answers. And importantly, it has traditionally required familiarity with a different set of languages. Learning these languages requires at least as much, and probably more, effort as it took to learn Python from scratch.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text  intended-text" id="p35"> 
   <p>This problem has stymied many busy Python developers without the time to invest in acquiring a whole new skillset, and prevented them from building full-fledged web apps. Luckily for you, we have a solution today: Streamlit.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text" id="p36"> 
   <h2 class=" readable-text-h2">1.2 What is Streamlit?</h2>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text " id="p37"> 
   <p>Streamlit is a pure Python frontend development library that lets you create web apps called <em>Streamlit apps</em> quickly and easily.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text  intended-text" id="p38"> 
   <p>As we've seen, a traditional challenge in Python development is that you need to either use a command line to execute your script or write non-Python code to create a visual interface if it's for the web. Streamlit disrupts this by allowing you to write a web-based UI in Python.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text  intended-text" id="p39"> 
   <p>In fact, one of my favorite ways to describe Streamlit apps to people new to them is "think of them as Python scripts where you can click buttons and stuff.”</p>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text  intended-text" id="p40"> 
   <p>Originally launched in 2019, Streamlit has exploded in popularity and usage in the last couple of years, bolstered by—among other things we'll explore shortly—its easy-to-grok syntax, its value in data science, and its support for creating LLM-based chatbots. So much so that in 2022, it was acquired by Snowflake Inc. for $800M.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text  intended-text" id="p41"> 
   <p>To give you a sense of Streamlit's rise, figure 1.1 shows a Google Trends chart:</p>
  </div>
  <div class="browsable-container figure-container" id="p42">  
   <img src="../Images/01__image001.png" alt="image"/> 
   <h5 class=" figure-container-h5">Figure 1.1 A Google Trends chart that shows the popularity of Streamlit over time (note: the dip near the end of 2023 is the week between Christmas and New Year's Day, when I assume relatively few people were working in the US)</h5>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text" id="p43"> 
   <h2 class=" readable-text-h2">1.3 10 reasons Streamlit is so popular</h2>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text " id="p44"> 
   <p>As figure 1.1 shows, Streamlit has enjoyed a fairly steady rise in popularity, especially beginning in 2022. Besides its vibrant community of individual users, the roster of companies that use Streamlit internally includes names such as Netflix, Airbnb, Stripe, and Square.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text  intended-text" id="p45"> 
   <p>There are many reasons that Streamlit has gained such acceptance, chief among them being its pure-Python nature and its ease-of-use for data science and AI applications in particular. In this section, we'll explore ten of these reasons.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text" id="p46"> 
   <h3 class=" readable-text-h3">1.3.1 Streamlit is pure Python</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text " id="p47"> 
   <p>Any code you write with Streamlit is Python code.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text  intended-text" id="p48"> 
   <p>Traditionally, creating a web-based interface has required developers to write HTML, CSS and Javascript, the three stalwart languages of the web. <em>HyperText Markup Language </em>(HTML) is used for page structure, <em>Cascading StyleSheets (</em>CSS) for appearance and layout, and <em>Javascript</em> for functionality.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text  intended-text" id="p49"> 
   <p>The trouble is, these languages (especially CSS and Javascript) can be hard to master if you want to create something relatively complex. There are frameworks built on top of these languages that help, but more often than not these have a learning curve, too. In any case, you'd still need to know HTML, CSS, and Javascript to use them effectively.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text  intended-text" id="p50"> 
   <p>Python, due to factors such as its ease-of-use and its rich ecosystem of libraries for data wrangling and analysis, is popular among data scientists, hobbyists, and even semi-technical people who learned it to help with their day jobs (and because it's fun). These groups are illustrated in figure 1.2. Their skillset may not extend to the three web languages, or they may only have a passing knowledge of them—usually not enough to create complex applications.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="browsable-container figure-container" id="p51">  
   <img src="../Images/01__image002.png" alt="image"/> 
   <h5 class=" figure-container-h5">Figure 1.2 Streamlit unlocks web app development for anyone who knows Python and helps even full stack developers prototype and build faster</h5>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text " id="p52"> 
   <p>Streamlit is a boon to these people because it lowers a huge barrier for them; it lets them create rich applications for the web without first having to invest time in learning another stack of languages.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text" id="p53"> 
   <h3 class=" readable-text-h3">1.3.2 Streamlit lets you go from idea to app in minutes</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text " id="p54"> 
   <p>When you start using Streamlit, I can guarantee that you'll be impressed by how little time it takes to create a working application.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text  intended-text" id="p55"> 
   <p>Due to its intuitiveness and the fact that it gives you sensible defaults for most things (which means you don't have to customize or configure them manually to look and work great), apps created in Streamlit are really quick to develop.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text  intended-text" id="p56"> 
   <p>Indeed, often, the time it takes to go from an idea to a fully working app can be measured in minutes rather than hours or days.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text" id="p57"> 
   <h3 class=" readable-text-h3">1.3.3 Streamlit makes beautiful apps</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text " id="p58"> 
   <p>Even if you do know some of the web-based languages I mentioned earlier, <em>knowing</em> them is very different from being skilled at <em>using</em> them to create web pages that look good.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text  intended-text" id="p59"> 
   <p>In Streamlit, the apps and pages you create are beautiful by default. That's because the elements (individual parts of an app, such as buttons, checkboxes or tabs) that Streamlit creates for you have been pre-designed to look good. All you have to do is put them together.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text  intended-text" id="p60"> 
   <p>As anyone who has used CSS to style a web page by hand (or tried to, at any rate) can tell you, it can be frustratingly hard to get just the right spacing you want between the edges of a button and its text, or the unique shadow effect you've dreamt up. And if, through force of will, you manage to implement exactly what you had in mind, it's <em>still</em> not guaranteed to be pretty, because UI design is as much art as it is science.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text  intended-text" id="p61"> 
   <p>Streamlit doesn't necessarily solve all of those problems for you, but it <em>does</em> make it so you have to go out of your way to create something that <em>doesn't</em> look nice.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text" id="p62"> 
   <h3 class=" readable-text-h3">1.3.4 Streamlit lets you focus on your app, not UI details</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text " id="p63"> 
   <p>Giving you pre-designed elements you can then combine to create apps has another advantage; it frees up your time to focus on the part you know best: your app's logic.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text  intended-text" id="p64"> 
   <p>Streamlit intentionally limits the UI choices you can make by choosing <em>for</em> you.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text  intended-text" id="p65"> 
   <p>As an example, take the snippet of code shown in Listing 1.1</p>
  </div>
  <div class="browsable-container listing-container" id="p66"> 
   <h5 class=" listing-container-h5 browsable-container-h5">Listing 1.1 Using tabs in Streamlit</h5>
   <div class="code-area-container"> 
    <pre class="code-area">import streamlit as st
 
tab1, tab2, tab3 = st.tabs(["Mission", "About us", "Careers"])
with tab1:
    st.header("Our Mission")
    st.write("Our mission is to teach people to make web apps in Python.")
 
with tab2:
    st.header("About Us")
    st.write("We are a group of Python enthusiasts.")
 
with tab3:
    st.header("Careers")
    st.write("We are hiring! Apply today!")
 </pre>
   </div>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text " id="p67"> 
   <p>You don't need to know how this works just yet, but it produces the tabbed page shown in figure 1.3.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="browsable-container figure-container" id="p68">  
   <img src="../Images/01__image003.png" alt="image"/> 
   <h5 class=" figure-container-h5">Figure 1.3 Tabs in Streamlit, illustrating how Streamlit makes UI choices for you</h5>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text " id="p69"> 
   <p>Turn your attention to the tab bar at the top. Notice the orange line beneath the tab we're currently on and the way the tab we're hovering over on is highlighted. Also, though you can't see it in a screenshot, the transition from one tab to another has a small animation where the orange line moves under the new tab.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text  intended-text" id="p70"> 
   <p>The line that produces the tab bar is the following:</p>
  </div>
  <div class="browsable-container listing-container" id="p71"> 
   <div class="code-area-container"> 
    <pre class="code-area">tab1, tab2, tab3 = st.tabs(["Mission", "About us", "Careers"])</pre>
   </div>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text " id="p72"> 
   <p>Notice how nothing in this line says anything about the styling we just discussed. We essentially just said "tabs" and Streamlit took care of the details for us.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text  intended-text" id="p73"> 
   <p>This is because Streamlit correctly recognizes that most developers don't want to design these UI-related minutiae and would much rather spend that time implementing their business logic.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text  intended-text" id="p74"> 
   <p>The result is that Streamlit app developers are highly productive, and able to churn out sensible interfaces that complement rather than detract from their functionality.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text  intended-text" id="p75"> 
   <p>That said, there is ultimately a tradeoff here between hassle-free UI development and fine-grained control. Streamlit works great for you if you care about the former, but not the latter. If you want to be able to exercise a lot of control over the finer aspects of your interface, Streamlit may not be the tool for you.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text  intended-text" id="p76"> 
   <p>For instance, as of the time of writing, if you wanted to put a shaded box around the current tab instead of a line underneath, you can't do that easily or without knowing HTML and CSS.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text" id="p77"> 
   <h3 class=" readable-text-h3">1.3.5 Streamlit's syntax is simple, concise, and intuitive</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text " id="p78"> 
   <p>One of the things I've always admired about Streamlit is how readable the syntax is. Like Python itself, Streamlit code is self-documenting and you'll often find what it does obvious.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text  intended-text" id="p79"> 
   <p>For example, let's say you want to simulate the roll of a die and plot the results in a graph. Consider the four-line snippet shown in Listing 1.2 that does this.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="browsable-container listing-container" id="p80"> 
   <h5 class=" listing-container-h5 browsable-container-h5">Listing 1.2 A die roll simulator in Streamli</h5>
   <div class="code-area-container"> 
    <pre class="code-area"> import streamlit as st

st.title("Die Roll Simulator")
num_rolls = st.slider('Number of die rolls', min_value=10, max_value=100)
if st.button('Plot Graph'):
    die_rolls = [random.randint(1, 6) for _ in range(num_rolls)]
    st.line_chart(data=die_rolls)
 </pre>
   </div>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text " id="p81"> 
   <p>You can see the output in figure 1.4.</p>
  </div>

   <h5 class=" figure-container-h5">Figure 1.4 Output of a die roll simulator in Streamlit</h5>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text " id="p83"> 
   <p>Notice how you can likely read the code in Listing 1.2 and make sense of it without having seen a single line of Streamlit code before: we show a title, display a slider for the user to pick the number of die rolls to plot (between 10 and 100), show a "Plot graph" button, and when it's clicked, we generate the die rolls (random numbers between 1 and 6) and plot them in a line chart.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text  intended-text" id="p84"> 
   <p>There's none of the "setup" code that you would see with other languages or libraries, such as defining a handler to listen for a button-click event or defining a laundry list of attributes for the slider. It's short and simple.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text" id="p85"> 
   <h3 class=" readable-text-h3">1.3.6 Streamlit is great with LLMs</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text " id="p86"> 
   <p>For better or for worse, technology had a watershed moment in 2022 with the launch and subsequent reception of OpenAI's generative AI chatbot, ChatGPT.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text  intended-text" id="p87"> 
   <p>To understand how the rise of generative AI has resulted in an explosion in popularity for Streamlit, consider the following:</p>
  </div>
  <ul> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p88">AI has captured the world's imagination.</li>
   <li class="readable-text" id="p89">Python is the most popular language for AI development because of its wide adoption across the industry and its rich ecosystem of AI-related libraries such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn, and LangChain.</li>
   <li class="readable-text" id="p90">Streamlit is the fastest way to write visual apps in Python.</li>
  </ul>
  <div class="readable-text " id="p91"> 
   <p>The intersection of these facts has meant that developers of all stripes have been flocking to Streamlit to develop AI apps.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text  intended-text" id="p92"> 
   <p>Streamlit itself was quick to capitalize on the sudden popularity of Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text  intended-text" id="p93">

  <div class="readable-text " id="p102"> 
   <p>Building a web app is one thing, but making it available to people is quite another. For a public-facing web app that doesn't use Streamlit, usually that involves finding a way to host it (such as using a cloud provider like AWS or even acquiring and managing your own servers).</p>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text  intended-text" id="p103"> 
   <p>All of this can seem intimidating (not to mention expensive) to the time-strapped data scientist or casual hobbyist, especially if the app they're trying to distribute is relatively simple and doesn't need to cater to thousands of users.</p>

  </div>
  <div class="readable-text  intended-text" id="p114">

  <div class="readable-text  intended-text" id="p118"> 
   <p>A dataframe is a table-based data structure that enables developers to ingest, wrangle and analyze data in various ways. If you're a data scientist, there's a good chance that you use it regularly in your work.</p>

  </div>
  <div class="readable-text " id="p124"> 
   <p>As we saw earlier, Streamlit saves you time by providing pre-built UI elements and limits the amount of customization you can perform on them.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text  intended-text" id="p125"> 
   <p>Most of the time, this is actually a good thing since it gives you space to focus on your logic. Other times, it can feel restrictive because the specific experience you have in mind may be challenging to build out of the box with Streamlit's building blocks.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text  intended-text" id="p126"> 
   <p>In these situations, Streamlit provides a way out in the form of Streamlit Components, which are modules that third-party developers can create to extend its functionality. Streamlit Components can range from things that fill perceived gaps in Streamlit's natively-available elements, such as a search box with autocomplete, to entire mini-apps (an audio recorder, say) that you can embed in your app.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text  intended-text" id="p127"> 
   <p>Streamlit publishes popular components in a gallery on its website where you can view how they look and work. Installing a component is as easy as installing any other Python library.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text  intended-text" id="p128"> 
   <p>If you have some frontend development experience, you can even create your own components.

   <p>Streamlit offers a versatile platform for creating a wide array of interactive applications. In this section, we'll explore the diverse range of projects that can be built using Streamlit, showcasing its adaptability and utility.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text" id="p131"> 
   <h3 class=" readable-text-h3">1.4.1 Data applications</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text " id="p132"> 
   <p>Streamlit was originally designed for data scientists, and its usefulness in creating data applications remains one of its greatest selling points.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text  intended-text" id="p133"> 
   <p>The kinds of data-related applications you can create with Streamlit include, but are not limited to:</p>
  </div>
  <ul> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p134">Dashboards that display metrics that decision makers at a company care about</li>

   <h3 class=" readable-text-h3">1.4.2 Internal tools for your workplace</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text " id="p139"> 
   <p>Data apps may be the most well-known use case for Streamlit, but in my opinion, it is equally well-suited for developing internal tools for employees at your company.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text  intended-text" id="p140"> 
   <p>This might include applications such as:</p>
  </div>
  <ul> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p141">Project management dashboards</li>
   <li class="readable-text" id="p142">Time tracking apps</li>
   <li class="readable-text" id="p143">Shift scheduling tools</li>
   <li class="readable-text" id="p144">Inventory management systems</li>
   <li class="readable-text" id="p145">File converter utilities, and more.</li>
  </ul>
  <div class="readable-text " id="p146"> 
   <p>Several factors make these tools ideal candidates for Streamlit apps:</p>
  </div>
  <ul> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p147">They generally need only cater to a limited number of concurrent users</li>
   <li class="readable-text" id="p148">They are scrappy in nature and may be required in a short time frame</li>
   <li class="readable-text" id="p149">Most companies don't have room in their budgets to hire full-time engineers to build them</li>
  </ul>
  <div class="readable-text " id="p150"> 
   <p>Streamlit is easy enough that even semi-technical people with a passing knowledge of Python can wield it quite effectively to build what they need.</p>

  <div class="readable-text" id="p151"> 
   <h3 class=" readable-text-h3">1.4.3 Apps that use Generative AI like LLMs</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text " id="p152"> 
   <p>Writing generative AI apps often tends to involve adding a thin layer of business logic on top of API calls to a generative AI service such as OpenAI's GPT or Anthropic's Claude.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text  intended-text" id="p153"> 
   <p>Streamlit works quite well for these tools, letting you roll out AI functionality with a UI in a short time with out-of-the-box support for common AI form factors such as chatbots.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text  intended-text" id="p154">

   <h3 class=" readable-text-h3">1.4.4 Prototypes for large apps</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text " id="p157"> 
   <p>Streamlit can be useful even to a dedicated software engineering team tasked with building a large, ambitious application. Such projects tend to be expensive in terms of developer time and effort to develop, and the work is spread out over months or years. Even with an iterative approach to development, it frequently takes a long time to see any results, at which point many incorrect and expensive-to-fix assumptions may have been made.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text  intended-text" id="p158"> 
   <p>Early design mocks help solve this issue, but prototypes are even better. With Streamlit, you can churn out lightweight working prototypes that mimic the functionality of the larger app quickly. This shows stakeholders what to expect, and helps validate basic assumptions about the functionality early on in the process.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text  intended-text" id="p159"> 
   <p>If you're a software engineer, going through this exercise not only saves the company time and money in the long run; it also drums up excitement among your partners and builds support for your work because people appreciate something they can experience first-hand more than design documents and mocks.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text" id="p160"> 
   <h3 class=" readable-text-h3">1.4.5 Anything else you can dream up</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text " id="p161"> 
   <p>Earlier in the chapter, I characterized Streamlit apps as "Python scripts where you can click buttons''. What this boils down to is that your Streamlit app can do pretty much anything Python can.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text  intended-text" id="p162"> 
   <p>You don't have to use Streamlit in ways that people are familiar with. You can find new, creative things to code up into an app. Here are some unconventional app ideas for inspiration:</p>
  </div>
  <ul> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p163">A personal AI habit-building buddy that lets you record your activity and offers advice and encouragement</li>
   <li class="readable-text" id="p164">A maze generator that generates fun puzzles (see figure 1.9)</li>
   <li class="readable-text" id="p165">A laundry tracker that keeps track of when your clothes need to be washed</li>
  </ul>
  <div class="readable-text " id="p166"> 
   <p>The point is, you should feel free to experiment! Often, learning a technology sparks ideas about new potential applications of it that only you could have thought about!</p>

   <h2 class=" readable-text-h2">1.5 What not to use Streamlit for</h2>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text " id="p169"> 
   <p>Like any other technology, Streamlit comes with tradeoffs. Let's address these by taking a look at a few things you can't (or probably shouldn't) use Streamlit to develop.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text" id="p170"> 
   <h3 class=" readable-text-h3">1.5.1 Complex, large-scale applications</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text " id="p171"> 
   <p>The size of a Streamlit app's ideal user base is likely measured in the hundreds or thousands of users, not in the millions.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text  intended-text" id="p172"> 
   <p>When it comes to concurrent users (users accessing your app at the same time), depending on the kind of app you're creating and its resource requirements to serve a single user, once you cross a threshold, your app may have trouble scaling.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text  intended-text" id="p173"> 
   <p>As we'll see in a later chapter, Streamlit works by running your entire Python script from top to bottom each time something needs to change on the app screen. This can have implications for performance, especially if your script executes heavy computations. Streamlit's caching feature can usually mitigate this issue, but you may occasionally encounter situations where you can't use caching.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text  intended-text" id="p174"> 
   <p>There are other reasons that Streamlit may be unsuitable for large production-grade applications, though you can often overcome these limitations by using third-party components. For instance, Streamlit doesn't have a built-in authentication feature, but there are Streamlit components created by other people that add this (e.g., <kbd>streamlit-authenticator</kbd>).</p>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text  intended-text" id="p175"> 
   <p>As the complexity of your app increases, you may find yourself straying from the beaten path more frequently. While the Streamlit forums are invaluable for identifying workarounds for features that Streamlit is missing, once your app reaches a certain level of sophistication, migrating to a different, more flexible framework (such as Flask, Django or some of the other options we explored earlier) with enhanced capabilities may be warranted.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text" id="p176"> 
   <h3 class=" readable-text-h3">1.5.2 Apps that require a high degree of UI customization</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text " id="p177"> 
   <p>Streamlit is designed to simplify adding most common UI elements into your app, but now and then you may run into situations where you want fine-grained control over how a part of your interface works. Streamlit's limited customizability may pose challenges here.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text  intended-text" id="p178"> 
   <p>Though Streamlit does offer some relief in the form of theming for color customization or the ability to write your own components (or include ones others have shared) to augment its native functionality, the larger point stands.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text  intended-text" id="p179"> 
   <p>If you need to have precise control over how your app looks or if there are specific visual effects you're trying to achieve, Streamlit may not be for you. Consider alternatives like React, a framework known for its flexibility and extensive customization capabilities (explored in the following section), or even manual page design with traditional HTML and CSS.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text" id="p180"> 
   <h3 class=" readable-text-h3">1.5.3 Native desktop or mobile apps</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text " id="p181"> 
   <p>Streamlit is a web framework, meaning that it produces apps that run within a web browser. If you're trying to develop desktop or mobile apps outside the browser, opt for native application frameworks such as PyQt or React Native.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text  intended-text" id="p182"> 
   <p>It's worth mentioning that you can still access Streamlit apps on mobile devices; the point here is that Streamlit does not produce standalone Android or iOS apps that run independently of the browser.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text" id="p183"> 
   <h2 class=" readable-text-h2">1.6 How is Streamlit different from other technologies?</h2>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text " id="p184"> 
   <p>If you've thought about or researched ways to create interactive applications in the past, chances are that you've come across or possibly used technologies similar or related to Streamlit before. This section compares Streamlit to some of these in an effort to clarify your understanding.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text" id="p185"> 
   <h3 class=" readable-text-h3">1.6.1 Jupyter notebooks</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text " id="p186"> 
   <p>A Jupyter notebook is an interactive environment for data exploration and working with code and visualizations. The concept is fairly simple: you write Python code (or even just text or markdown) in a "cell,” execute it, and see the output (which can be text, some kind of visualization or even something interactive) directly below. The output of each cell is retained so you can see what came before it.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text  intended-text" id="p187"> 
   <p>Useful for things like explaining your thought process, playing around with data, and sharing your work with colleagues, Jupyter notebooks have become a mainstay in the data science community.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text  intended-text" id="p188"> 
   <p>Jupyter is similar to Streamlit in a few respects: they are both Python-based, both support tabular and graphical data, both integrate with popular libraries like pandas, and they are both popular in the data science world.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text  intended-text" id="p189"> 
   <p>However, there are also important differences:</p>
  </div>
  <ul> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p190">Jupyter is used to create interactive documents, rather than actual apps; it is best used for sharing your code and explanations with collaborators rather than having that code be executed by actual end users. Streamlit, as we've seen, is used to create apps for end users.</li>
   <li class="readable-text" id="p191">Jupyter's support for engineering practices such as version control is sketchy; this is fine because it's meant for exploratory analysis, not shipping production dashboards. Streamlit, on the other hand, fits well into a regular engineering workflow.</li>
   <li class="readable-text" id="p192">The audience for Jupyter notebooks consists of technical folks, not laypeople. Streamlit doesn't require the users of your app to be able to read or understand code.</li>
  </ul>
  <div class="readable-text " id="p193"> 
   <p>All told, Jupyter notebooks are a fantastic initial tool for experimenting with code, data and charts. Streamlit is an amazing tool for building and sharing the final buttoned-up interactive experience you want users to have, often using the code, data and charts you finessed in your Jupyter notebook.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text" id="p194"> 
   <h3 class=" readable-text-h3">1.6.2 HTML, CSS and Javascript</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text " id="p195"> 
   <p>As we discussed earlier, HTML, CSS, and Javascript are the big three complementary languages of the web.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text  intended-text" id="p196"> 
   <p>HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is used to provide the structure and content of a web page, and define elements like headings, lists, divisions, and links through a tree of "tags" which can contain other tags.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text  intended-text" id="p197"> 
   <p>CSS, or Cascading StyleSheets, lets web developers manage the appearance, layout, and formatting of many different web pages in a central place. CSS has options to set colors, spacing, fonts, borders, and more.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text  intended-text" id="p198"> 
   <p>Javascript is a programming language primarily used to define the dynamic behavior of a web page. It can be used to create animations, validate forms, connect to other webpages, and pretty much anything else you'd want a web site to do.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text  intended-text" id="p199"> 
   <p>Together, these powerful languages enable you to build any web experience you want. While they aren't difficult per se to learn, using them effectively to create complex apps is a laborious process, so much so that "frontend" development is its own discipline in software engineering.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text  intended-text" id="p200"> 
   <p>Streamlit abstracts away the complexity of using these languages in their raw form and lets you use a simpler, more concise syntax to write web pages, working in the background to generate the equivalent code that a web browser can understand.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text" id="p201"> 
   <h3 class=" readable-text-h3">1.6.3 React</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text " id="p202"> 
   <p>React is a popular Javascript framework that helps you create fast, responsive web pages. Like Streamlit, it is an alternative to using raw HTML, Javascript, and CSS to create web applications.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text  intended-text" id="p203"> 
   <p>React follows a reusable component-based design where you build up parts of a web page using smaller parts and then combine <em>those</em> parts to build larger parts, working all the way up to a full application. Each such part you create is called a component, and can be reused in your app or even shared with other people so they can use it in theirs.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text  intended-text" id="p204"> 
   <p>React has a declarative programming approach where you describe the UI you want, and React takes care of updating the DOM (the tree of HTML elements that lies under your web page) to match it.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text  intended-text" id="p205"> 
   <p>While React is incredibly powerful and used by frontend developers to create complex UIs, its architecture and approach can be challenging to wrap your head around. It is also not Python-based.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text  intended-text" id="p206"> 
   <p>Though Streamlit actually uses React under the hood, from the programmer's perspective, Streamlit trades some of the power and flexibility of React for simpler semantics, pre-built elements with some customizability, and the ability to use Python to write web pages.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text" id="p207"> 
   <h3 class=" readable-text-h3">1.6.4 Flask and Django</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text " id="p208"> 
   <p>Flask and Django are both Python-based web frameworks.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text  intended-text" id="p209"> 
   <p>Flask is lightweight and minimalistic. It's designed to be straightforward to use, and is quite flexible, allowing developers to choose the various libraries and tools they prefer rather than being prescriptive. Flask provides the essentials you need to create a web app, such as the ability to handle routing and HTTP requests, while leaving most of the design choices beyond that to the developer. It's popular with web developers who want to employ a modular approach or exercise a high degree of control.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text  intended-text" id="p210"> 
   <p>Django, on the other hand, is feature-rich and sophisticated. It's more opinionated than Flask, following specific design patterns such as the MVT ("Model-View-Template") architecture. It also comes with many built-in modules for common tasks, such as an admin panel to manage your data models. Django is a popular choice to run powerful enterprise-grade applications.</p>

   <p>While Flask and Django are similar to Streamlit in that they can all be used to build web applications, a key distinction is that Flask and Django are primarily <em>backend</em> frameworks to be used in conjunction with your <em>frontend</em>, which still consists of HTML/CSS/Javascript that you have to write or embed within your Python code. Not so with Streamlit, which lets you write frontend code in pure Python.</p>

   <h3 class=" readable-text-h3">1.6.5 Tkinter and PyQt</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text " id="p213"> 
   <p>Tkinter and PyQt (pronounced "pie-cute") are Python libraries used to create graphical user interfaces (GUIs).</p>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text  intended-text" id="p214"> 
   <p>Tkinter comes bundled with Python and provides a set of widgets you can use to create a desktop application. It is popular with beginners and suitable for creating simple apps.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text  intended-text" id="p215"> 
   <p>PyQt is similar, but it's more powerful and mature (and more complex) than Tkinter. It's actually a wrapper around the C++ Qt application framework. PyQt lets you create quite sophisticated GUIs and has a wide range of features.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text  intended-text" id="p216"> 
   <p>As you might have guessed, the key difference between Tkinter/PyQt and Streamlit is that the latter is used to create web applications, not desktop applications. Over the last couple of decades, users have increasingly become comfortable with web-based software that never needs to be installed or updated, which makes Streamlit arguably more useful than the other two for most use cases.</p>

   <h2 class=" readable-text-h2">1.7 Learning through projects</h2>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text " id="p218"> 
   <p>Now that we know what Streamlit can and can't do, let's talk about what's in store for you as you go through the rest of this book. I strongly believe that the best way to learn a piece of technology is to gain experience in using it.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text  intended-text" id="p219"> 
   <p>This book is designed to give you this experience by building real projects that require you to think through actual problems and how to solve them. In fact, through these projects, we will learn not only about Streamlit itself, but also:</p>
  </div>
  <ul> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p220">large language models (LLMs) like OpenAI's GPT, and how to create LLM-powered apps</li>
   <li class="readable-text" id="p221">best practices around User Experience (UX) and User Interface (UI) design</li>
   <li class="readable-text" id="p222">best practices around code organization and structure</li>
  </ul>
  <div class="readable-text " id="p223"> 
   <p>Here's a sneak preview of some of the things we'll build together:</p>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text" id="p224"> 
   <h3 class=" readable-text-h3">1.7.1 An interactive metrics dashboard</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text " id="p225"> 
   <p>In this project, we'll study the requirements of a CEO who needs to make important decisions about their company, and design an interactive dashboard that they'll look at every day to understand what's going on in the business.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text  intended-text" id="p226"> 
   <p>Along the way, we'll explore Streamlit's charting and visualization capabilities, as well as how to work with Pandas dataframes.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text" id="p227"> 
   <h3 class=" readable-text-h3">1.7.2 A rent-vs-buy housing calculator</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text " id="p228"> 
   <p>In our second real-world application, we'll evaluate the benefits and costs of owning a home as opposed to renting, and design a calculator that helps people make their decision.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text  intended-text" id="p229"> 
   <p>Here, we'll experiment with Streamlit's layout options and different ways for users to provide inputs. We'll also dive deep into how Streamlit maintains state.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text" id="p230"> 
   <h3 class=" readable-text-h3">1.7.3 A CRUD application</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text " id="p231"> 
   <p>Our next stop is a <em>Create-Read-Update-Delete </em>(CRUD) application where you'll need to go beyond a siloed app and establish a connection to a database for persistent storage.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text  intended-text" id="p232"> 
   <p>We'll see how this unlocks powerful possibilities in the kinds of things you can build. We'll also explore data tables and theming.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text" id="p233"> 
   <h3 class=" readable-text-h3">1.7.4 An AI trivia app</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text " id="p234"> 
   <p>With three real apps that explore Streamlit's key features under your belt, it's now time to turn your attention to the exciting world of generative AI. To get a taste of what you can do in this space, we'll design an app that can answer trivia questions using OpenAI's GPT.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text" id="p235"> 
   <h3 class=" readable-text-h3">1.7.5 A chatbot</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text " id="p236"> 
   <p>In this project, you'll expand your LLM capabilities with the LangChain libraries and build your very custom chatbot. We'll learn how Streamlit's chat elements make this easy to do.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text" id="p237"> 
   <h3 class=" readable-text-h3">1.7.6 A custom knowledge base</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text " id="p238"> 
   <p>Want a second brain? For our third LLM project, that's essentially what we're building. We'll learn how to integrate various sources of information into a query-able knowledge base and expose it in a Streamlit app.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text" id="p239"> 
   <h3 class=" readable-text-h3">1.7.7 Your own Streamlit component</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text " id="p240"> 
   <p>This one's pretty advanced, so strap in! We'll first identify some functionality we want that Streamlit's pre-built elements can't serve out of the box. We'll then use the React framework to create that functionality and integrate it into an app.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text" id="p241"> 
   <h2 class=" readable-text-h2">1.8 Summary</h2>
