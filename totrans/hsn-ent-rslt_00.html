<h1>Preface</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p>We all want to make better decisions. Whether it’s to better serve our customers or to keep them safe, we want to make the right judgments and do the right thing. To act with confidence we need to understand who we are serving and what their place is in the world. While there is often an avalanche of data available to us, too often it isn’t joined up and doesn’t tell us the full story of the individual before us.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Entity resolution<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="entity resolution" data-secondary="definition of term" data-type="indexterm" id="id265"/> is the art and science of connecting the data, joining the dots, and seeing the full picture. This book is a practical guide to help you reveal that wider context and help you be fully informed before you act. It’s often taken for granted, but you’ll see in this book that matching up data isn’t always straightforward—but don’t worry, by the final chapter you’ll be well equipped to overcome these challenges and bring your datasets to life.</p>&#13;

If you are struggling with the challenges of siloed data that doesn’t join up, have competing views of your customers in different databases, or are charged with merging information from different organizations or affiliates, this book is for you.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Risk management professionals charged with combating financial crime and managing reputation and supply chain risks will also benefit from understanding the data matching challenges laid out in this book and the techniques to overcome them.</p>&#13;

<h1 class="less_space">Why I Wrote This Book</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p>The challenge of entity resolution is all around us—we may not use those words but every day this process is repeated time and again. A few weeks before completion of this book, my wife asked me to help her check names off a list as she read out a list of payers from a bank statement. Had all the people on the list paid? This was entity resolution in action!</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>The idea for this book was born out of a desire to explain why checking for a match against a list of names is not as easy as it sounds, and to showcase some of the amazing tools and techniques that are now available to help solve this problem at scale.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>I hope that by guiding you through some real-life examples you will feel confident in  matching up your datasets so that you can serve and protect your customers. I’d<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="questions and comments" data-type="indexterm" id="id268"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="comments and questions" data-type="indexterm" id="id269"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="feedback, providing" data-type="indexterm" id="id270"/> love to hear about your journey and any feedback on the book itself. Please feel free to raise any issues with code that accompanies this book on <a href="https://github.com/mshearer0/HandsOnEntityResolution">GitHub</a>, or to discuss entity resolution in general, please contact me<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="contact information" data-type="indexterm" id="id271"/> on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mshearer0">LinkedIn</a>.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Entity resolution is an art, as well as a science. There is no one-size-fits-all prescribed solution that will work for every dataset. You will need to make decisions about how to tune your process to achieve the results you want. I hope that readers of this book will be able to help each other find the optimum solutions and benefit from shared experiences.</p>&#13;

<p>This<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="code examples, obtaining and using" data-type="indexterm" id="id272"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="entity resolution" data-secondary="approach to learning" data-type="indexterm" id="id273"/> book is intended as a hands-on guide, so I encourage you to follow along with the code as you work through each chapter. A key design tenet of the book was  to illustrate the challenges and solutions using real-world open source data. This brings with it some challenges if you are following along because your results may vary slightly as the source dataset is updated from the date of publication. Please check the <a href="https://github.com/mshearer0/HandsOnEntityResolution">GitHub page</a> for any recent updates and to access the code that accompanies the book.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<ul>&#13;
	<li><a data-type="xref" href="ch01.html#chapter_1">Chapter 1</a> provides a basic introduction to entity resolution, why it is needed, and the logical steps in the process.</li>&#13;
	<li><a data-type="xref" href="ch02.html#chapter_2">Chapter 2</a> illustrates the importance of standardizing and cleansing data before attempting to match records together.</li>&#13;
	<li>Chapters <a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="select:labelnumber" href="ch03.html#chapter_3">3</a> through <a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="select:labelnumber" href="ch06.html#chapter_6">6</a> show how to compare data records to resolve entities using approximate comparisons and probabilistic matching techniques.</li>&#13;
	<li><a data-type="xref" href="ch07.html#chapter_7">Chapter 7</a> describes the process of grouping together records describing the same entity into a uniquely identifiable cluster.</li>&#13;
	<li>Chapters <a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="select:labelnumber" href="ch08.html#chapter_8">8</a> and <a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="select:labelnumber" href="ch09.html#chapter_9">9</a> illustrate how to scale up the entity resolution process using cloud computing services.</li>&#13;
	<li><a data-type="xref" href="ch10.html#chapter_10">Chapter 10</a> shows how records can be linked while preserving privacy between data owners.</li>&#13;
	<li>Finally, <a data-type="xref" href="ch11.html#chapter_11">Chapter 11</a> describes some further considerations when designing an entity resolution process and offers a few closing thoughts on likely future developments. </li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
&#13;
<p>I would recommend Chapters <a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="select:labelnumber" href="ch02.html#chapter_2">2</a> through <a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="select:labelnumber" href="ch09.html#chapter_9">9</a> be read consecutively because they incrementally build entity resolution solutions using shared problem datasets.</p>&#13;

Interactive tutorials are available at <a href="http://learnpython.org"><em>http://learnpython.org</em></a> to get started, or I recommend <em>Python for Data Analysis</em> by Wes McKinney (O’Reilly). More advanced readers would benefit from knowledge of pandas, Spark, and Google Cloud Platform.</p>&#13;

<section data-pdf-bookmark="Acknowledgments" data-type="sect1"><div class="sect1" id="id235">&#13;
<h1>Acknowledgments</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p>I have learned that writing a book is very much a team effort. I am grateful to have been given the time and space to assemble this guide and for everyone who said yes, and gave their time freely, to make it happen.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>First, I’d like to acknowledge Aurélien Géron, whose book <em>Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow</em> inspired me to consider writing a hands-on guide. I’d also like to express my appreciation to all my former colleagues at HSBC who put entity resolution techniques to such good use in combatting financial crime.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>I’d like to thank everyone at O’Reilly, starting with Michelle Smith, Senior Content Acquisitions Editor, for entertaining the initial idea and crafting the proposal. Sincerest thanks to Jeff Bleiel for his editorial skill and guiding hand throughout the drafting process. Thanks to Aleeya Rahman, Production Editor, for her guidance on formatting and the art of LaTeX, and to Kristen Brown, Manager, Content Services, for publishing the early releases, which were such an encouraging milestone. I’d also like to recognize Karen Montgomery for such a fitting front cover illustration—are the birds a match?</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>I am especially grateful to reviewers Robin Linacre, Olivier Binette, and Juan Amador. Thanks to Juan for introducing me to the topic of entity resolution several years ago and inspiring me to learn more; to Olivier for his expert guidance on the state-of-the-art and his pioneering work on evaluation; and to Robin for his commitment to explaining the complexities of entity resolution in a practical, accessible way. I’d also like to acknowledge the Splink and OpenMined teams for the open source frameworks upon which much of this book is based—“standing on the shoulders of giants” comes to mind.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Lastly, I’d like to pay tribute to my beloved wife, Kay, for her support and patience throughout the process. I’d also like to thank my daughters: Abigail for challenging me to frame the subject in an accessible way and Emily for encouraging me to never give up!</p>&#13;
