    by showing you how to write actionable code so that you can learn by doing. The
    book contains simple examples that explore key concepts in detail. The graphics
    in earlier chapters will familiarize you with how the maps look and how different
    tools can render relationships. Later chapters explore the code and various platforms,
    empowering you to use Python as a resource for answering geospatial questions.
    If you are looking for flexibility in manipulating data in both open source and
    proprietary systems, Python may be the missing piece of the puzzle. It is fairly
    easy to learn and has a variety of libraries for pivoting and reshaping tables,
    merging data, and generating plots.

    drivable, or bikeable urban networks with a single line of Python code, then easily
    analyze and visualize them. You can also download and work with other infrastructure
    types, amenities and points of interest, building footprints, elevation data,
    street bearings and orientations, speed, and travel times. [Chapter 5](ch05.xhtml#openstreetmap_accessing_geospatial_data)

- en: So far, I am simply describing the distribution of points, polygons, or lines
    within our research location. Raster data is represented as an array of values
    divided into a grid of cells. The terms *cells* and *pixels* describe spatial
    resolution and are often used interchangeably. The dimension of the cell or pixel
    represents the area being covered. *Spatial data models* take these abstract representations
    of real-world objective and/or field views and explore mathematical relationships
    to model or predict relationships.

    data on the expanded bands of light wavelengths. This enhanced data, beyond simply
    red, green, and blue wavelengths, allows machine-learning models to distinguish
    among a wide variety of objects. This is because different objects reflect infrared
    light in different ways, yielding additional information in a multispectral image.
    Many space agencies around the world make data from their Earth observation satellites
    available freely. These datasets are immensely valuable to scientists, researchers,
    governments, and businesses.

- en: It is necessary to consider multiple concepts simultaneously when reviewing
    a systems-level approach to GIS. The smaller components working within a larger
    system interact dynamically to reveal patterns in the system. Geometric visualization,
    for example, includes calculating distances between features, calculating buffer
    regions (how far away one feature is from another, for example), and identifying
    areas or perimeters. It will simplify our discussion if you think of these topics
    as parts of a whole. Understanding these introductory concepts will simplify your
    learning in the following chapters. It is important to begin with a baseline of
    spatial literacy.

    following along in a new application, or even launching your own independent geospatial
    project. The datasets in this book have been vetted and found workable on a wide
    variety of applications and workflows.

    about a dataset is called *metadata*. Often there is also a supplemental data
    file that describes attributes like field headings. This is called a *data dictionary*.
    You can explore an example: the [Landsat Data Dictionary](https://oreil.ly/BgBaG),
    published by the US Geological Survey (USGS).'

    as the label on a can of soup: you read it because you want to know what the ingredients
    are and whether the soup is good for you. [Figure 1-10](#example_of_metadata)
    shows an example of metadata. The most important information you’ll want to check
    should include the geographic area shown, the attributes listed, the map projection
    the dataset uses, its scale, and whether there is a fee to use it.'

- en: The field of geospatial analysis is vast, and Python is an expansive topic about
    which much has been written. It’s hard to imagine any single book introducing
    either of these topics, let alone both, in a complete and authoritative manner.
    So I won’t attempt to do so in this book; instead, the goal here is to explain
    important foundational elements and introduce you to open source tools and datasets
    that you can use to answer geospatial questions.

    systems, projections, and the two main types of geospatial data: vectors and rasters.
    You also began to learn how to think spatially, and we finished with an introduction
    to datasets and how to choose what data to work with. Don’t be alarmed if this
    all seems like a lot! Right now, I just want to launch your curiosity by sharing
    the possibilities of working with open source geospatial data using Python.'
