<h1>Preface</h1>


<p>This book is aimed at the data scientist with some familiarity with the <em>R</em> and/or <em>Python</em> programming languages, and with some prior (perhaps spotty or ephemeral) exposure to statistics.  Two of the authors came to the world of data science from the world of statistics, and have some appreciation of the contribution that statistics can make to the art of data science.  At the same time, we are well aware of the limitations of traditional statistics instruction:  statistics as a discipline is a century and a half old, and most statistics textbooks and courses are laden with the momentum and inertia of an ocean liner. All the methods in this book have some connection—historical or methodological—to the discipline of statistics. Methods that evolved mainly out of computer science, such as neural nets, are not included.</p>

<p>Two goals underlie this book:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>To lay out, in digestible, navigable, and easily referenced form, key concepts from statistics that are relevant to data science.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To explain which concepts are important and useful from a data science perspective, which are less so, and why.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h5>Key Terms</h5>
<p>Data science is a fusion of multiple disciplines, including statistics, computer science, information technology, and domain-specific fields.
As a result, several different terms could be used to reference a given concept.
Key terms and their synonyms will be highlighted throughout the book in a sidebar such as this.</p>

<h1>Using Code Examples</h1>
<!--PROD: Please reach out to author to find out if they will be uploading code examples to oreilly.com or their own site (e.g., GitHub). If there is no code download, delete this whole section. If there is, when you email digidist with the link, let them know what you filled in for title_title (should be as close to book title as possible, i.e., learning_python_2e). This info will determine where digidist loads the files.-->

<p>In all cases, this book gives code examples first in <em>R</em> and then in <em>Python</em>. In order to avoid unnecessary repetition, we generally show only output and plots created by the <em>R</em> code. We also skip the code required to load the required packages and data sets. You can find the complete code as well as the data sets for download at <a href="https://github.com/gedeck/practical-statistics-for-data-scientists"><em class="hyperlink">https://github.com/gedeck/practical-statistics-for-data-scientists</em></a>.</p>

<p>This book is here to help you get your job done. In general, if example code is offered with this book, you may use it in your programs and documentation. You do not need to contact us for permission unless you’re reproducing a significant portion of the code. For example, writing a program that uses several chunks of code from this book does not require permission. Selling or distributing examples from O’Reilly books does require permission. Answering a question by citing this book and quoting example code does not require permission. Incorporating a significant amount of example code from this book into your product’s documentation does require permission.</p>

<p>We appreciate, but do not require, attribution. An attribution usually includes the title, author, publisher, and ISBN.

<section data-type="sect1" data-pdf-bookmark="Acknowledgments"><div class="sect1" id="idm46522874978792">
<h1>Acknowledgments</h1>

<p>The authors acknowledge the many people who helped make this book a reality.</p>

<p>Gerhard Pilcher, CEO of the data mining firm Elder Research, saw early drafts of the book and gave us detailed and helpful corrections and comments. Likewise, Anya McGuirk and Wei Xiao, statisticians at SAS, and Jay Hilfiger, fellow O’Reilly author, provided helpful feedback on initial drafts of the book.
Toshiaki Kurokawa, who translated the first edition into Japanese, did a comprehensive job of reviewing and correcting in the process.  Aaron Schumacher and Walter Paczkowski thoroughly reviewed the second edition of the book and provided numerous helpful and valuable suggestions for which we are extremely grateful. Needless to say, any errors that remain are ours alone.</p>

<p>At O’Reilly, Shannon Cutt has shepherded us through the publication process with good cheer and the right amount of prodding, while Kristen Brown smoothly took our book through the production phase. Rachel Monaghan and Eliahu Sussman corrected and improved our writing with care and patience, while Ellen Troutman-Zaig prepared the index. Nicole Tache took over the reins for the second edition and has both guided the process effectively and provided many good editorial suggestions to improve the readability of the book for a broad audience.  We also thank Marie Beaugureau, who initiated our project at O’Reilly, as well as Ben Bengfort, O’Reilly author and Statistics.com instructor, who introduced us to O’Reilly.</p>

<p>We, and this book, have also benefited from the many conversations Peter has had over the years with Galit Shmueli, coauthor on other book projects.</p>

<p>Finally, we would like to especially thank Elizabeth Bruce and Deborah Donnell, whose patience and support made this endeavor possible.</p>
